112,"
5... Nc6 6. d3",",Meanwhile, this is how ION opens up a line for his Bc1.  I am not surprised as it's generally not wise to do a double fianchetto.  I have done that a couple of times but have, except for one or two occasions, gotten myself into trouble, that way."
112,"
6... g6",",After some careful consideration on what to do with my Bf8, I decide to fianchetto.  The reason being is that I don't want to disturb the layout or structures of the Sicilian Defense.

112,"
9... Bxe2",",?! On the other hand, I was worried that retreating would allow his Ne2 to become dangerous since the pin would be broken.  I asked myself a similar question to what Ken has told me to ask myself as well as others to ask myself.  That is, what would I do, if ION had the option of something like 10.Qd2, and then 11.f5, with the idea being 12.Nf4.  In other words, what would I do, if he could repost his N to that square, as then it would be dangerous.  By exchanging, I felt like I might have stopped a problem before it started.  Come to think, the N moving wasn't really of a concern, and therefore, I should not have given it too much thought.  Better would have been to retreat my LSB, as it was certainly not worth the exchange given that there's potential for his Nc3 to become as dangerous.  The point is that I might have been use my B at a later point in time, as Ken has mentioned.  I think that what really needs to be worked is exploring my options.  For had I done that, I thought about what those pieces could really do, I wouldn't have made this exchange."

Il grande cubano fece una svista in apertura e perse un pezzo, ma anziché abbandonare, come avviene in questo caso nelle partite di alto livello, tentò di resistere. Lo svantaggio si dimostrò troppo grande anche per un giocatore della sua classe. Questa sconfitta costò a Capablanca il primo posto nel torneo (si classificò pari secondo a mezzo punto da Aaron Nimzowitsch)."

When he said that, Jack might of thought that he was taking me off guard since it appears like something different.  I say that because even though this mentor taught me the defense, he hasn't played it in a while.  So, my guess is that by saying it, Jack's reminding me of how intense openings can be.  However, I am very used to it, as that is the main defense that I play.  So, for now, everything is not only standard, but it's what I'm most used to."
73,"
2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5",",That is, until now as 5...a6 is the most common move, in this position.  The idea being to, as we know, prevent 6.Nb5 or 6.Bb5+.  But, this move is just as effective, and this, in reality, where I'm reminded of how intense openings can be.  It used to be, even after my second training game with Ken, that I went wrong by not knowing what to do when someone played something against me that I'm not used to.  That was, especially in the opening when entering unfamiliar territory.  Yes, the second training game with Ken was very helpful as he is also a good coach.  However, unlike what you'd think, it did not solve the problem.  Overtime, I learned, even though it might not be the right attitude to just expect the unexpected.  I learned that if I'm prepared for anything expect to be surprised, unfamiliar openings or moves will not take me off guard.  Therefore, I'd know how to handle.  For example, the Spanish opening starts off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5.  However, we can see a similar setup in the Sicilian.  For example, Jack and other's have also played 5...Nc6.  This used to take me off guard and, back in the day, caused me to go wrong.  However, I calmly play 6.Bb5 as that gets me back into familiar territory.  When, it does not work in that position, I find something similar to make it work.  But, the idea is to just stay calm and collected and pretend that it's yoga.  That is how I adjust to something I'm not used to.  It's the analogy that I have created to compare yoga to chess when getting into something that intense.  The journey is to yoga as the position is to chess.  Just like with yoga that takes you on the journey, in chess, every position is different.  Some intense.  But, we don't fight or run away from it (which is what the Fight or Flight Syndrome is.)  Instead, we accept it for what it is and learn to adjust."
73,"
6. Nf3",",With that being said, I just go back to where the N originally was.  This is also just like Yoga.  It would be like you're supposed to do the balance.  But, you lose it.  How do you handle it?  Well, you don't struggle to keep the foot up.  Instead, you just put the foot on the floor.  And, when you're in standing facing dog and lunge, you don't struggle to get the foot on the mat.  Instead, if it doesn't make it on it's own, you help it to get there with your hand.  Well, the same thing here.  I wanted to do a lot with the N.  But, I couldn't find any squares.  The only thing I thought might be logical was 6.Nf5 but am not ready to exchange.  Therefore, I just returned the N to where it originally was.  And, it's worth noting that the loss of tempo here is of no concern to me."
73,"
6... Bg4",",The downside is the pin.  Of course, I'm used to seeing it."
73,"
7. Bg5",",I did consider 7.Be2, but I felt that if Jack could pin, it was safe for me to pin, as well.  When he breaks it..."

73,"
8... Nc6",",Not surprisingly, Jack develops."
73,"
9. Bb5",",So, I directly pin.  Worth noting that even though I'm calm and collected, the one thing that doesn't work is becoming too happy about the position, as I remember with Ken combined with other games.  There was one where being too happy lost the game, at once, as that's when I let my guard down."

So, I defended again to match the equation.  However, my original play was 11.Nd5?? which would've been a disaster.  And, that's where the coaching began.  Jack: 11.Nd5?? loses immediately.  I then told him that there was a variation where I'd capture material.  And, he said, ""Even if you were to capture, I'd get a piece without compensation. "

73,"
13. Qd3",",Doesn't bother me the least bit, as I break the pin.  The only downside is that Jack exchanges before I'm ready.  As I like where my Nf3 was placed.  But, my guess is that Jack didn't want me to do anything else with the N which is why he took.  Despite not being ready, I also kept in mind that he may exchange, with which, I take back with the Q and maintain a strong position."
73,"
13... Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Rc8",",The idea is keeping my other N tied down.  The idea is, in general, if I move it, the c pawn will fall.  In fact, that's what Jack mentions while coaching me, which we'll see soon.  Not knowing what else to do it, unlike a couple of moves earlier, I am now ready to exchange.  So, I go for it.  In part, I didn't know what else to do.  And, in general, when I'm not sure, the way to not be taken off guard is going by what my instincts tell me without giving it a lot of consideration.  The reason is because thinking about me too much has also generated the Fight or Flight mechanism, in the past, which is also where I'd go wrong.  In fact, that's one reason that it took me a long while to surpass beginner status, let alone, where I am today.    That's why I give the absolute threshold (just enough) consideration to ask myself the chances that it will work.  But, if it is possible, I do it.  More often then not, it's exchanging, as I feel more comfortable doing so.  As for me, it is about getting rid of my opponents pieces, especially when they look strong.  But, that's especially in this context as I was going by GM Susan Polgar's general advice to exchange N for B.  Well, that's exactly what happened here. "
73,"
15. Bxf6 Bxf6 16. Rac1",",As that gives me enough time to defend the c pawn again.  However, this move was also possible.  But, as noted, I exchanged because it looked beneficial, since we're talking about N for B.  If it was the B, instead, I would not have done that.  Before this move, my original play was, once again 16.Nd5 with the same idea.  This time, it was being that one of my pieces wasn't en-prise.   This is where, like with Ken, Mr. Stockel gets into my thought process and coaches me.  Jack: Why did I play 14...Rc8  Joe: I'm not sure because my Nc3 is protected.  Jack: It's because I knew that you would play Nd5 with which your c2 pawn is unprotected.  So, it's up to you.  Well, that led me to making the right choice because it is certainly not worth a pawn.  With stronger players, it's generally not a piece, but rather, a pawn that makes or breaks the game as this mentor has emphasized.  Therefore, I play this, to allow my Nc3 to move since it is now defended again."
73,"
16... Bg5",",However, I overlooked this move, as the c pawn was attacked.  So, in this case, it was almost counterproductive for getting rid of the half pinned.  Nonetheless, I will find a way around this, sooner or later.  "
73,"
17. Rcd1",",First, I protect."
73,"
17... Qf6",",Once Jack plays this, I exchange Q's.  In this context, however, I would've declined.  But, the idea behind it is that in the aftermath, I am going to win a pawn.  That is the most important thing on my mind because it was too often that I have missed the opportunity to win material against my coach.  The reason being is because of what Ken mentioned in a previous annotation.  As it turns out, I have trusted Jack too much to make good moves which is how I've overlooked his bad moves.  However, that's why I remember not to trust my opponent.  And, by not doing it here I catch his error and take advantage with this variation that will leave me a pawn up."

It frees no pieces, nor develops any, nor does it add to Black's claim on the centre.  It does stop a White minor piece from landing on b5, but that is a very minor consideration that doesn't inconvenience White at all.  There are better things for White to do!"

191,"
6. O-O b5",",[!?] Totally unexpected, this is one of those moves that can really disrupt one's programme.  The upsides for Black is that it's a forcing move: where is the c4-bishop to go?  It loses no time, therefore, and does go some way to Black's development by offering her LSB a choice of directions to go. It also has some - a little - impact on the centre. There are downsides, though.  It is Black's fourth pawn move, and the LSB doesn't really need the extra mobility.  The light squares in Black's Q-side might prove interesting for White, and Black really ought to be looking at mobilising her bishops.  This is not a bad move, but it had the psychological effect of encouraging an ill-advised follow-up by Black."

Forcing as they are, they can help with seizing the initiative, or be the means by which one makes progress.  However, this Q-side expansion is rather premature, and ought to have waited upon the bishops being brought into the board.  Moves like 7...Bg4 or ...Be7 were much to be preferred.  Also good would have been 7...Na4 (!?), even though it moved a knight already moved, to the edge of the board, as it would pretty much have forced White to permit the exchange of his best piece."

The sapient reader will have observed that White is in no all fired hurry (now) to complete his own development.  The reason is simple.  Right now White has ample resources to mount an attack sufficient to gain a decisive advantage.

In the aftermath, I looked at reversion's game against dipole_moment.  There was a very similar threat but not including a Q sac.  Instead, reversion played 26...Qxe5, but had he recaptured with the R (26...Rxe5), dipole_moment would've had a mate in 4, involving the back rank, as well.  So, I thought that it would work here being that if he takes here, it's mate in 3.  However, I knew that Charles would see this threat.  However, I thought it would be very difficult for him drive it off without losing his Q, but I was wrong.  As it turns out, I overlooked the intermediate checks that are about to follow.  Instead, much better would've still been threatening mate and trying for a stalemate with 25...Rxe3.

Likewise, he would've defended again with 63...Kg2.  So, I'd recheck with 64.Rg4+.  And, those moves would repeat themselves and become a draw by repetition.  But, Jack said that the other way to draw would be if I did not go back and forth.  Therefore, it's what else would happen after 63.Rh4 Kg2.  In this case, 64.Nxe5 fxe5 65.Rxh2 Kxh2 66.Ke4 which allows 67.Kxe5  After which, it is a dead position which is also a draw as we're only left with the K's.  And, there was 2 games that I drawed with a dead position.  This happened before joining this website.  So, the summary is that Jack said that I went wrong by moving too quickly in the beginning which is why he allowed me to draw this game.  I agree with my coach, but he, as usual, he is not completely accurate.  Where I agree was the urge to play Nd5 too early.  The first one was 11.Nd5?? which would have left me a piece down.  And, the second instance was 16.Nd5 which would've lost a pawn.  So, he is correct in that sense.  But, what Jack did not point out was where I also went wrong.  In this case, it was 53.Rd7?  I would've had a win with 53.Kd5! as the K supports the pawn.  It also has to do with mobility since the K and passed pawn would work together to force the promotion.  Thus, while I need to take a little longer due to the opening, my assessment on mobility needs work.  I have gotten better at thinking more about it.  But, when to apply it is still shaky.  As I didn't think about it in the place where it was needed the most.  So, the real moral of this story is that mobility is one of the most important aspects in chess.

As part of this process I thought that I would annotate my games, good or bad, win or lose, and show you my thought process as it evolves. As it turns out this game was a great one to start on as I got a great position and went in for a crushing attack and was better very quickly. Doesn't always work out this way, but this game was nice. "

207,"
4. b4",",Signifying the Evan's Gambit. The idea behind this attack and many similar opening gambits is to sacrifice a pawn for active counterplay on some part of the board, relying on compensation for the pawn. What is the compensation here? White intends to castle quickly, get the rooks in the middle and somehow keep black's king in the middle to attack. Alternatively there is often a strong attack against the f7 pawn if black castles with the bishop on c8 undeveloped. So white is playing against passive pieces and a slightly airy king. Lets see how this one goes. "
207,"
4... Bxb4",",The most critical lines of a gambit are ones where the sacrifice is accepted. It is not considered a good idea to take with the knight, and on move 5.. we will explain this further.  Suffice to say if you are going to take, bishop is best. If you wish to decline, Bb6 is fine, and if I play game in that line I'll also annotate to see what we can learn about that position. Enough to say it is also a reasonable alternative. "

If 5..Bc5 then 6. d4 exd4 7. cxd4 and white has a very strong center and easy development. Black's pieces are awkward and has a lot of problems to overcome. This whole idea is why taking with the knight on the previous move doesn't really work. White still just plays c3 here, and d4 next, with a nice center, easy development and soon will look for a strong attack. 5..Ba5 aims to stop all that because if d4 then the c3 pawn is pinned to the king and can't retake, making that strong center. Which white player would try that."
207,"

The best way to play here would be O-O and only then to play d4. d4 is playable to be sure, but white has give away enough pawns that they now MUST get an attack going or the material advantage will be decisive. Some line like 6. O-O d6 7. d4 and black has many options that don't include giving white the massive center. "

I will note the computer has liked white's position for a number of moves yet but this is the one where it's best variations start giving up material for active piece play, which is normally how I determine that one side is actually properly ahead.

As the idea is gaining tempo by attacking the B with that move, as the plan is 5.d4  So, it's what we call the c2-d4 plan since they're all aligned up.

While I agree with what Ken said which is that it's not the only thing to keep in mind.  I also agree with reversion's assessment because of what GM Susan Polgar outlined.  What she said is how I stopped trying different openings just because it's possible.  What Susan said is that what should be played is what you have the most experience with.  Although you have seen the other move, I feel the most comfortable with this move.  Of course 4...Nxe4 is a conditional move, as I'd quick play 5.Re1 "

He said that better was to capture immediately with 5.Bxc6  And, the reason is that with stronger players it's better to exchange just because it's possible.  When I'm not sure, I go by what he says.  But, as ION has said, ""Don't trust your opponent"".  And, I know that he is wrong in this case.  In fact, that's why I fell into a bad habit of exchanging whenever possible since he said that with Tom Levine.  However, Ken mentioned in our first training game that one should not exchange just because it was possible to do so.  And, refusing the exchanges is what helped him to win the game.  Although problematic still with exchanges, it got better.  That was mainly when I asked Susan Polgar when it's appropriate to exchange.  But, what Jack outlined is wrong.  That's because deeper_insight (TA) mentioned that, in this position, it's better not to exchange.  Instead, after ...a6, the best response is Ba4, and after ...b5, Bb3 is played.  On the other hand, after ...Na5 the exchange is forced, but it's better to exchange at that phase then it is at this stage.  So, I really go wrong is a later on."

The idea is to stay calm and collected when that happens because of how intense openings can be.  When this happens, getting nervous is the worst you can do as then the Fight or Flight Syndrome takes over.  Instead, this is where I apply what I learn in Yoga and just adjust.  The way to do is come up with a variation.  In this case, while it sounds unsound, I'm trying to see if there's a chance of winning Jack's Rh8 or Q.  If now 6...b5, 7.Bb3 would become a problem for that reason."

In this case, I felt that Jack was faced with a lot of pressure which in return made the position look difficult for me.  I felt that the only way for Jack to avoid losing a piece (R or B without compensation) was 9...f6  That was a conditional move with which I'd play 10.Bxf6+.  And, after 10...Rxf6 11.Bxf6+ Kxf6.  And, while everything seems even, given that I have a P and R for two minor pieces, I'd get an advantage.  As Jack's King would be exposed being that the weakest pawn is gone.  So, that's the only variation that came to mind.  In other words, it's the only that came into consideration.  But, as Ken and fiercequeen in one of her annotations, more needs to be considered.  In other words, I need to be thinking about more variations such as what happens next.  As that is what causes the oversights.  With that being said, this is where I really go wrong.   In fact, it is the losing blunder, as he is going to win a piece without compensation just like we saw in my second with Ken.  Much better was to leave the B on b3 and let him exchange.  As now, it's still even.  Not only that but, I might even benefit from that despite doubled pawns as it would be his N for my B."

And, after 11...Rxf7 12.Qxe5 winning back a piece.  In the end, Jack would only be a pawn up.  But, my belief is that despite that, I'd get an initiative since my K is safer.  That was the logic behind this move as I had that variation in mind."

10... Bxg5",",But, Ken asked me the same question in one of the training games that Bonnie asked me in her annotation which is when I said that a certain move gives white two attackers against one defender.  And, fiercequeen asked, what if black played the R up.  And, I realized that a second defender would be added.  So, my assessment was wrong.  The same thing happened here.  It was off, as I had overlooked this being played, instead.  With that, there's nothing that I can do with my N because it is now gone.  It only get worse."
65,"
11. Bxg5",",?? Instead of asking myself what to do, I felt that I was safe here as it appeared to get material back.  What I forgot is that, first, I am still an entire piece down.  Second, this move gets me in another phase of trouble.  What I don't realize is that this move will cost me another piece.  Thus, it has now become a resignable position.  And, it was all caused by the oversights from just playing my moves, as opposed to, going through the variations.  But, I am not aware of what is to come.  It is afterwards that I figure out the consequences, in which I realize that it's too late to save the position.  Much better would've been 11.Nc3.  My idea was avoiding liquidation.  But, after 11...Bxc1, 12.Raxc1 or 12.Rfxc1, black was able to liquidate.  But, white hasn't lost any more material.  "

Similar to what happened in my second game with Ken, I am forced to liquidate Queens, in order to prevent Jack from winning my d5 pawn.  In the end, he said that I could have defended with 21.Nc3??.  But, that won't do, as he'd get my Queen, instead.  So, this is where I came to the realization that white's position is hopeless.  And, there's nothing else to get from continuing to play on.  When the game was over, Jack and I reviewed it.  He was almost enfuriated with my play here.  I can understand why, Mr. Stockel said that this was the one of the worst openings that he's ever seen from me.  So, we went to the beginning.  We even started a new game.  Unfortunately, he didn't go over it correctly since he said that it started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6  But, he played the Berlin Defense with 3...Nf6 followed by that moved.  And, he said that my losing blunder occurred right after he played ...Nd4.  Better was to just accept the exchange and get the DSB into play.  He was right there, as I miscalculated a variation and played a move that was easily countered, when I thought that I had pressure.  But, what my mentor said next, including the moral to this story is completely incorrect.  According to Jack, although not the losing blunder, I started going wrong by retreating with Ba4, instead of exchanging with Bxc6.   So, when we started a new game he made me play Bxc6 after ...a6.  Getting wrong on how this game went, we started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6.  But, we did not finish or get far with the game since Tom Levine came to play Jack.  With that comes his moral which is why I, for a long while, was in a bad habit of exchanging recklessly before the lesson with Ken.  As he said that the lesson to be learned is that when you're up against stronger opposition the idea is to exchange early and often.  By that, he means as much as possible, or doing so just because I can.  His logic is that stronger players want their pieces, so if you allow it, they become dangerous.  His moral, however, is wrong because of what Ken mentioned.  As the idea is that, in general, you might need those pieces later on.  So, just exchanging material without any thought is wrong on all levels.  And, as I know, Ken's correct.  With that being said, although I've reached the next level of seeing the board, what I must remember is to calculate the variations accurately.  That's what's needed to advance even further of good chess play.  What I forgot which Ken emphasized is that stronger players look at multiple variations, as opposed to, just one variation.  What I'm guilty of is only looking at one or two variations and thinking that they work which leads to oversights.  For example, I studied only one long set of variation when playing the blunderous 9.Bd5?? followed by 11.Bxg5?? which lost more material.  Although it didn't lose anything else, even 10.Qh5 was wrong because of how "

163_1,"
20... Rdc8",",What I overlooked was this move since my pawn is attacked.  The problem is that I didn't think it mattered because of what this mentor said when I took one of two doubled pawns before.  The best example was in the tournament game against Tom Walsh to which I should've lost.  And, that was when he was yelling at me, as we know, and later calming down and saying I shouldn't target those pawns because it's two bad pawn when I have a piece under attack.  This is when we were saying good bye to each other a week prior.  I kept that in mind and didn't think, he'd take.  The difference is that in the last game, as noted, it involved an attacked piece that was only defended once and attacked twice.  But, in this position, it's not attacked.  However, there is no way to defend c4 even if I wanted to which is also a problem with doubled pawns, in general.  That's because with connected pawns, one often defends another.   Therefore, I know he'll take but hold off for as long as possible with my next move, as his Rook will be attacked.."

163_1,"
22. Rad1",",So, I decide to centralize one of my Rooks, at once.  And, the reason that I used this Rook is that it will allow me to centralize the other Rooks because of where the center is located, as we know."
163_1,"

163_1,"
23. Nd5",",So, I get aggressive by trying to hold of his attack on my c pawn.  Therefore, I thought that the way to go was threatening an exchange.  As, I'm keeping in mind not to trust the opponent.  The good news here is that he did trust me with his next move.  That's because Jack thought that I'd exchange which I wasn't going to do.  Instead, I used what I call scare tactics to continue the idea of playing the man. "

24... Rcc8 25. Rd5",",So, I intend to put pressure on Jack.  Although it is defended, I was trying to take advantage of Jack by making him think that N is under attack.  Not a good strategy, for once he moves it, my c pawn is gone.  But, when he takes it, I am decide to play something similar to Hope Chess because of what Ken mentioned in our training, when there was nothing else to los."

25... Ne4 26. Ra5",",The hope is that Jack will attack my Rook with ...b6, in which, I'd get a pawn back.  But, that plan is not going to work.  And, sure enough he will win another pawn.  So, it is a lost position.  All I can do is hope that Jack will go wrong.  That's because resignation is almost called for, but as it turns out, Jack will make mistakes which is going to allow me to win.  As noted in the intro Jack will do that for teaching purposes, as we'll see later on."

163_1,"
29. Bb6",",So, I refuse."
163_1,"
29... Re4",",So, if Jack can't get anything else, he threatens mate.  "
163_1,"
30. Nd3",",? I was tempted to try and defend with 30.f3??, but with his N on d1, I'd get mated in the same way.  Aside from that, this is the only other move that came into consideration.  As I didn't want to open up since it's not an endgame.  But, better was to open up with 30.g3, or 30.h3.  By playing this, my N is now semi cramped.  I should've kept it on b4, where it would have been better placed."
163_1,"
30... Rc8",",This is why.  Had it stayed there, Jack would not have been able to win another pawn.  With what I played, he will get it.  This will, in return, leave me to an equivalent to a piece down."

I know that you wanted to get your N to a better spot since it is about getting your pieces to a better square. But, better was to leave your N on e7. In this position, it was better placed.

But, it was 20...a5 that I overlooked.  But, losing a pawn isn't completely off.  So, I was a little overly critical but not completely to say ?? I understand why you played this. As the Queen appears attacked. But, black has other options, like 19...Nb8, 19...Na7. I don't like it on a7 as well as it's on the rim. And, bringing back to b8 does undevelop, though from there, it can go to d7, followed by f6 with a nice position. However, best was 19...Ne7, as now I'm forced to retreat. And, from there, black 20...Nf5 where the N is well placed. But, this move, however, is going to lose more material.  Correcting a little bit of what I said, I reposted by saying,  Edit: 19...Nb8?? does not work as the Rook is not protected. But, better was 19...Na7, or 19...Ne7 However, for the reasons noted, 19...Ne7 was best.

However, 23.Nc7 was a forking move because your Ra8 was also attacked. Despite losing another pawn, 20...a5! was a good move and the only one in the sequence that I overlooked. But, in this position, with two pieces attacked, you could have defended both with 23...Qc8. As now, my N is pinned to the Queen. And, after something like 24.Bf4 Ra7 25.c3 Na6 26.Nxa6 Rxa6 27.Qxc8 Rxc8 white doesn't win anything else.  But, after that, I wasn't going to give any more advise because of what ION said.  And, that is not to critical when you have the winning advantage.  As up until this point, there was no clear winning initiative, even if white had an advantage.  That's so, but an advantage doesn't necessarily mean winning.  It's different, when one is more then a piece up.

That's because as it will turn out later, the idea is that after Ng5, I'd follow up by capturing with the Queen on f7, and then h7 where it is mate.  And, it would be if Sue saw the threat and protected.  Or if she would overlooking it by taking the B since I'd be giving something back, and as a method, that's generally what you do when ahead.  However, mate is almost threatened, and with it, I, very nearly, overlooked 29...Qxh2#  That not only would've thrown away the advantage in a winning position.  But, as it is a teaching, Sue would not have learned, as then, she'd be able to pull a swindle.  And, the idea is that once you have advantage, if can be avoided, you don't want to give the student their advantage back, as Ken emphasized before our training sessions.  That is why I am upset with myself.  It's a good thing that I used analyze the board, but the bad part is that it got me spoiled since I overlooked a similar threat against Jack Stockel and got mated on the back rank.  The point is that before even using analyze the board, I should've seen the threat, rather then need to see what the opponent or in this case, the student was threatening.  Now, I could've protected with 29.g3, but when you see a good move, look for something better.  I thought that this was better since there is the added threat against the Queen, in which must be protected.  As now, g5 square won't be blocked which will allow me to play the same thing that would've lost with this move.  So, what I'm alluding is, indeed, 30.Ng5."

For black, the only way to prevent mate was 30...Nh6, after which, I'd capture with 31.Bxa5.  Not only would be another pawn up, but it would be very difficult for Sue to defend her Nb4.  In fact, after that, I'd threaten, perhaps, mate again with something like Bb4 forcing further liquidation, and perhaps, a later Qc5 with Qe7 or Re1 in mind.  All of that would add more pressure to the King but would not mate at once.  With this move, I have it and will take advantage of that opportunity."

At that point, I wouldn't have been able to take your Rook. So, what you remember for the future is how powerful the pins can be. Sometimes, they're not a big deal. Or another way of looking at it is just a nuicanse. But, other times they can be very dangerous, so you want to ask yourself when it's serious or not.

For example, taking attacks the Queen, and if ...Qe8, I can attack with something like Nd6.  So, there are some very interesting variations that come into this move.

1. e4","Today in my quest of game annotation I continue my examination of games that I have played in the Evan's gambit. Unlike the first game that I played, this game was a closer affair with an interesting attack that lead to a winning endgame. Let's examine. "
156,"
1... e5",",As normal with the Evan's gambit I will be making notes on what the computer (Komodo) says in these positions is the best move, focusing on what black should be doing on defense and what white should be doing on the attack. The usual caveat with machines not always understanding a position exists, however, machines tend to be quite good at concrete lines and tactics, which the Evan's gambit is full of. "

2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4",",Signifying the Evan's gambit. Black does not actually have to take this pawn, but if they don't they do fall back into a passive position with white gaining space and often an attack as well. "
156,"
4... Bxb4",",Also the best way to refute a gambit is to accept it. "
156,"
5. c3",",One of the main ideas in the opening is to stop black from developing properly all while opening avenues for your pieces to attack. At some point the idea is that black will have to give back some material to stay in the game and at worst white will have an even endgame. That is the idea of course. Does not always happen that way. "
156,"
5... Ba5",",The best move, keeping an eye on the e1 square for the future. "
156,"
6. d4",",This is the variation I have been trying so far. It is a full 3 pawn sac if black wants. Check out another game I annotated if you would like to see how that might go. http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=62485"
156,"
6... exd4",",The natural move, accepting another pawn and asking white what their idea is. "
156,"
7. O-O",",The full three pawn sacrifice, at least temporarily. Black can take on c3 and be up three pawns and down in development. Or they can start to develop but give white a strong center with many nice attacking chances. "
156,"
7... d6",",Black chooses the latter idea and plays the natural looking d6 move. There are often ideas here of white playing e5 because d6 is now a target to attack, but if white can't figure out a way to do that then it opens up the light squared bishop and tries to control some important squares. "
156,"
8. cxd4",",Here is the first important position of this game. Black has to decide how to unravel his pieces and there are a lot of possible lines for white to attack. White is still down a pawn, or course but is ready to begin an attack. The a5 bishop is controlling e1, so the rook can't come into there if white can open the center, and the threat of Qb3 is such that the c8 bishop is kind of stuck. Interesting position though, and one of the reasons I like the Evan's gambit. Lots of ways for black to go wrong. "
156,"
8... Nge7",",Potentially getting ready to castle and developing. This move seems kind of odd to the eye, but Bf6 doesn't really work because it allows white to play e5 at the right moment with tempo and smash open the center with likely tactics to go along with it. "
156,"
9. Ng5",",I think this is probably the best move in the position, though I did also consider Qb3 and some other normal looking development moves. This prevents black from castling here though because if 9..O-O then 10. Qh5 looks great, threatening mate on h7 and pressuring f7 as well. 10..h6 11. Nxf7 Rxf7 wins the exchange and keeps a very strong attack going. Of course black has to figure out how to deal with the pressure on f7 without castling."
156,"
9... Rf8",",Defending f7. Take a minute and think what you should play. White clearly has a nice position. You could play Qb3 or Qh5 with extra pressure on f7 which is somewhat hard to meet nicely. You could just take on h7 with the knight, for the rook to move, and then repeat the position at material equality. You could just take on f7 anyway, giving two pieces for a pawn and a rook and then play Qh5 at the end to pick up the h7 pawn anyway. Not to mention some Ba3 developing move or e5 trying to smash open the middle. Consider what you'd play and we'll talk about it in a second."
156,"
10. Qh5",",This is what I played. I thought it better than Qb3 because it have the option of taking with the queen instead of taking with the bishop if black doesn't meet this properly. I thought that if g3 then Qxh7 looked great and that I was likely to win an exchange in the worse case scenario. The computer likes Nxh7 here with the idea that 10. Nxh7 Rh8 11. Ng5 Rf8 12. Qh5 is the same but now black can't block with Ng6 so easily. if 12..Ng6 then Nxf7 Rxf7 Qxg6 (not possible right now because the h7 pawn would protect g6) and white is crashing through winning the exchange in a great position instead of in an unclear position. If you think another move works as well let me know in a comment. I'm always looking for interesting ideas in this opening. "
156,"
10... d5",",(!?) pretty cool try by black here. In most of these lines I end up winning the exchange but taking on h7 with the knight and winning the rook for that knight. The real question is who is going to have the initiative after the dust settles and this idea opens up some nice squares for the black pieces and gives black a bit of activity. "
156,"
11. exd5",",Taking with the bishop allows him to trade the knight for the bishop and keep simplifying, which helps his cause. "
156,"
11... Nxd5 12. Nxh7",",(?!) My thought here was that I'm winning an exchange by force, but this allows black to complicate the matter needlessly. Better is to just play a developing move. 12. Nd2 or Bd2 is better (blocking the e1 square from the black bishop so the rook can open up against the king. Remember, material here is dead equal and white has a great attack going. Not that the h1 rook has moved they are not castling any time soon so slow playing is better. Winning exchanges is still a reasonable thing to do though. "

But, I saw what's going on, as I went wrong in a similar way with a team game.  I believe he gave me a pawn with the same type of threat.  By, overlooking his had two Rooks against one in a back rank.  So, when he captured, I resigned because recaptured is forced, with which, he would've mated me at once.  Knowing that, combined with comments from bhidragon about those basic threats, I figured out what Jack wants, and I put a stop to it.  However, that was not before considering 29.Ne7+ which is effective.  But, I asked myself the question about mobility.  Like if I could free my N, and then make a threat of my own.  I didn't see it any, and I wouldn't be able to do anything with right away.  For after Jack would get out of check, this threat would remain.  So, the move after is what I decided to play right away.  As GM Susan Polgar put it, I opened up a window to stop the threat."

Even though there's no tournament game, Mr. Stockel wants all of his students to have a chance to play for learning purposes which is sensible.  And, what he told Perry is that it's even.  I agree.  It stays like this for now but will change shortly when the first mistake is made.  For one move only, Jack gave him advice.  I thought that this would go on and off, in which, it would turn into an OTB consultation game.  But, that didn't occur since Jack was busy studying the OTB tournament games."
157,"
12. Ne5",",With that being said, I played this to either force Perry into having doubled pawns by exchanging on c6, or if he exchanged on e5, black would face a tremendous amount of pressure with Bg5.  However, this is where Jack gave Perry advice to exchange on e2, first by saying, ""Take the Bishop"".  He was wondering, and questioned it.  But, Jack told him just to take that way.  Then, after looking harder, he said, ""Ok, if you say it is the best move, it must be.""  And, he played 12...Bxe2  Even though I didn't say anything, I agree with Jack.  However, Jack was going to spend time on the tournament, and when the games were over, that's when he was going to give his post game analysis on what the player did wrong.  In fact, that's one reason that there are absolutes time controls, as well.  On top of getting used to it for the real deal with tournaments, having the restrictions, gives Jack time to analyze and give advice for the future.  As that way, you learn and improve."

4... a6",",But, Jack took me by surprise with this move.  If this were played a move earlier, I would not be taken off guard.  It all goes to show just how intense openings can be.

And, I decided to follow up on it.  His question was if instead of playing Ba4, would I, for once, consider exchanging on c6.  The answer is that with a normal Spanish Opening I have, until I found out that it doesn't accomplish what I thought it did.  Since the only purpose was doubled pawns.  However, Jack took me off guard by playing it later, so my response is also trying to take him off guard.  Therefore, I decided to make that capture, at once.  As I have a plan once he is force to take back, and it's based on the idea of playing 4.c3."

That's because from an instructive dream, I have learned not to become too happy about the position.  As there are things that you might be missing from that.  Instead of being happy, ask yourself what to do.  Well, I did after 5.Bxc6, as I realized that after what you saw, I could castle.  And, that was the plan."

As keeping the K safe is vital."
86,"

Might not be the right approach, but the idea is not to be taken off guard by things that you're not used to because as Ken taught, openings can be intense."
151,"
3... Nf6",",With that being, I stick with what I'm used.  As I'm holding off on developing my Nb8 because of the general guidelines on that N in QPO, being that I might be able to use the c pawn at a later time."

4. Bg5",",Trying to put pressure on me.  To my knowing and concern it didn't work because it's not pinned.  "
151,"

But, this is an inaccuracy because will get a favorable exchange which puts me at a disadvantage.  For one thing, he is exchanging, my N for his B.  As with most position, the N is, in general, more favorable, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar.  In fact, that's why when I asked her about exchanges, she said that as a general rule, you should exchange the N for B.  And, she also stressed it in the mega bundle course that I purchased which is, ""Polgar University 2017.""  This is everything that she is covering in the university where she is teaching chess.  So, by ignoring what's occurring, Jack will be able to get the exchange that Susan has mentioned.  Second, in the process, Mr. Stockel will be able to double up my pawns.  And, what's worse is that I'll be forced to recapture away from the center which is another benefit for white.  Better was to self impose the pin by advancing my e pawn, but then, Jack would still get the beneficial exchange.  Therefore, best was to retreat my Nf6."

151,"
11. Ne2",",I was surprised to see Jack develop this way.  In this position, I had expected to see 11.Nf3 where the N appears a little better.  With that, I'm going to castle next with the idea of freeing up my Nc6.  However, I did not spend enough time to think about Jack's next exchange since it will, once again involve my N for B.  As noted, this is going to be beneficial.  Better was to delay it even longer with 11...Nb8.  And, now, if Jack is to exchange, it would be my B for his N which wouldn't be as bad, and in fact, for the reasons noted earlier, may even be beneficial for black."

Therefore, my way of calling it unfinished is still in progress, but you can call it, from another perspective, a draw since we won't be going back to this game.  Meanwhile, I'm gonna have to work on playing better when time is of the essence.  I have improved though because the week after this game was played, I played another tournament game.  With a bigger handicap, I had only 20 min. against his 55 min.  I took my time, and thus, almost timed out.  But, with a better position, I was able to force the win, regardless.

That distraction became terrible, as you're about to see.  It won't change the plan, but it causes me to overlook something else which turned into a bad move, similar to what you saw in my first training game with Mariann where I coached her, as per Ken's comment.  That was when I failed to take a piece but took a pawn, instead.  The intention was to protect the B, but I don't need the B when I've got something better.

Well, there was, and this is where the distraction took over as I was thinking even exchange and doesn't achieve much.  Whereas, the promotion is a killer.  But, due to my Bh6, 30...Rc1# is checkmate.  In the future, I wish that Jack Stockel wouldn't just move or change things around as that's how I overlook these things since I consider it extremely distracting."
50_1,"
30. Rxf2 a5",",But, Jack said that it's lost, and Ted resigned.  I agreed with Jack.  The plan behind the R sac for this move is that I was planning something like 31...Ra6 and after 32.Ra2, I'd have 32...b6.  And, I keep using those pawns chains one by one where each advances one square until I've promoted.  But, I forgot that after 33.Bf1, I'm now forced to retreat.  In fact, he could even stop those variations with 31.Bf1.  After which, even after moving my R and playing something like a later ...b6, he has Ra2.  The only thing that would help is ...Rd5+, but Ted can block with something like Rd2.  And, in some of these variations he would have an advantage.  Ted and I just didn't realize due to the distractions.  But, Jack then said that after 27...Bh7, white was hopeless.  It's true, and I don't even mind him watching or commenting after the game to coach us.  But, what I didn't enjoy was him getting involved and changing things around before the end of game.  I guess it is good practice.  And, what I've got to learn and get better is knowing how to overcome these distractions.  As that way, I won't miss something like 29...Rb1+ which would've mated, at once."

Even though it's not a London System, what I studied there from Susan Polgar is very applicable here because with the move played, it would now be a mistake for Charles to take on b2.  As now, Jeremy would have 7.Na4, and this would be followed by 8.Ra1 leaving the Queen virtually trapped.  That is a very well known fact.

174,"
10... Qxc3+",",But, Charles has other ideas since he took the pawn, instead.  It appeared to be a free pawn.  However, I believe that this is the losing move because of what's to follow.  And, I only say that because of the misfortune with Jack Stockel in my first game with Tom Walsh on Friday, during the tournament.  So, it was the game before my very last annotation, in which Jack Stockel yelled at Tom and I which had negative affects on our play during the second game.  The mistake that should've lost was taking a pawn.  Sure, I was up a Queen for a minor piece or two.  But, then I took the doubled.  The problem was my N being pinned against my Queen with two of his Rooks.  I was very lucky that Tom overlooked it, but had he doubled up on one file, I would've lost the N, and would have to hand back my Queen to avoid mate.  From then on, I would be in a lost position.  Well I believe that more or less could be said here since these two pawns are weak.  And, is combined Jeremy's Ne5 and Bb5 becoming the killers for this game."

37. Rf3","So, I attack the B.  Therefore, Jack told Carl that he doesn't have to win the pawn right away.  Instead, it can wait since the idea is not letting me get the Bishop.  As the idea behind it is not allowing white to get anything else.  That's because even though the position appears even material wise, black certainly has an advantage.  I am hoping that there is a miscalculation which will turn it the other way or end the game in a draw.  But, that isn't so since black is keeping the advantage.  The reason for his advantage is because his g and h pawns are dangerous.  In fact, those are the killers.  With two isolated pawns against his connected pawns, black has the better end of it.  Now, had I stuck to this game and not let the anger get to me, those exchanges would've been refused.  And, I believe that it would've been level."

42... Bf1 43. Ra8+",",After seeing what has happened to me in a couple of games, combined with what Susan Polgar showed in a stalemate lecture that would end the game in draw by repetition instead, I attempted the same idea.  That's right, I'm trying to trick to black into a draw by repetition.  And, that's by checking on the seventh and eighth rank.  Jack even asked me what I'm trying to do, and I told him that I thought that this might be a draw.  So, I persist on these checks."

43... Kh7 44. Ra7+ Kh8 45. Ra8+ Kg7 46. Ra7+ Kf6",",But, Jack has had enough, and he told Carl that he's not ready to let white off with a draw yet.  I thought that it was forced but overlooked that the K could go on the sixth rank.  Besides which, it wasn't a draw because black's position didn't repeat themselves 3 times the way that white's position did.  But, that was my attempt which didn't work, and having enough checks he decided to play this."
137_2,"
47. Ne8+",",However, I missed the that would've resulted in a swindle.  It was due to Tunnel Vision because I thought that my N was on a different line from black's King.  Therefore, I thought that if Rf7+, he could take the Rook but forgot that it was protected by the N. Therefore, best was 47.Rf7+.  And, now it goes from a disadvantage to win for white.  It was due to a similar fork that GM Susan Polgar showed in her book of Chess Tactics for Champions.  As that Bishop would've been free.  In doing so, I would've been able to move my Kc6 and promote the passed pawn.  And, Carl wouldn't have been able to stop it in anyway.  With this move, white is lost because black will stop it with his Bishop."

50... Bxc6+ 51. Kxc6 Rxa5 52. Ng7",",So, it officially becomes Hope Chess.  Up until recently, I'd resign at this point.  But, I decide to let Carl promote and see where it goes from there because of what I remember from GM Susan Polgar.  The reason why it's Hope Chess is that mate will be inevitable, unless Carl messes up.  But, if he does that, I could still pull a swindle and get a stalemate.  I've seen examples from Susan where one side is even further ahead then black will be, even after he promotes.  But, Jack said that I have no hopes and implied that there will be no mistakes.  I don't completely trust him since he some time ago made a mistake that allowed me to checkmate in a hopelessly lost position."

137_2,"
57. Kxh6 Qg5+",",But, that came to an end here.  In fact, Jack asked me how I was going to avoid checkmate here.  The answer is that it's unavoidable here.  That's because my monarch is stuck in the corner.  So, after 58.Kh7, Carl can just leave the Queen there and play 58...Ra7.  After that, my N is pinned, and thus, forces 59.Kh8.  From there, he'll checkmate with 59...Qxg7#  Seeing all of that, I resigned here.  I think the important lesson is that even if something happens that makes you angry, you shouldn't let get it you in a game.  Since that will affect one's judgement as it will happen to me.  For example, that's the main reason why I went back to exchanging just because it was possible to do so.  As otherwise, I would've been more patient and held off.  But, the other lesson is that opportunities only last a shortwhile.  And, had I play 47.Nf7+, I would've been back in the game with an advantage.  But, by missing that followed by another inaccuracy, it was over for white.  Well, after this game, Carl and I played one more which remains unfinished as we ran out of time.  But, Jack still took the time to coach like he did with these two games."

Instead, I'm treating like the Spanish Opening, in which case, after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6, it is better to not exchange right away with 4.Bxc6  I found the logic behind this with GM Susan Polgar.

In the process, I'm going to lose a piece for a pawn.  With best play, which I expect from black, Charles will win the game.  I am, however, not resigning yet, as I feel that there is more to learn.

5. Nf3",",That doesn't mean too much, though, as I looked at moves like 5.Nb5 and 5.Nb3  But, as usual, I didn't spend more then a few seconds considering them because I really didn't know what made them better or not.  Therefore, I just didn't see the point as one move with the N doesn't seem better or worse then the other.  So, I figure that it made the most sense to get the N back to it's original square and work my way from there."

The real reason is that it brings black one step closer to castling.  And, I say that because I also would've given 6...h6 some consideration.  But, I don't like what happens after black castles which is why it would've ruled out of court, as that way, none of the pawns near the castled King have moved."

With this played, I considered exchanging 8...Bxc6  But, not getting doubled pawns in return and, thus, keeping two connected pawns, I didn't see the point.

However, after a little consideration, I decided that exchanging is doesn't benefit black.  And, to my knowing, I might get an edge as his Bg4 appears stronger then my Nf3.  Therefore, I felt that a good strategy, in this position, is to connect my Rooks at once by moving the Queen to same rank as my Knights since, as usual, I have no idea of what else to do.  Obviously, I'm not going to exchange on c6."

10. Qd3 Bxf3 11. Qxf3 Qb6",",As the saying goes, ""Don't trust your opponent"".  His instincts are right because another plan behind 10.Qd3 is that with Queen and Bishop on the same line, white, I believe, would get a stronger position.  So, Jack does what he can to stop it."
163,"

163,"
12... a6 13. Bc4",",So, I play this, as opposed to 13.Ba4, and it's still under the technicality that pressure against that f7 pawn worked in one game.  Plus, I was also a little worried that if I went back to a4, he could move the Queen which would threaten to trap my Bishop, with a later ...b5 which is somewhat similar to what we see in the Noah's Ark Trap.  So, I felt that to avoid any complications, combined with what happened in one game, this was best.  Now, if things, get out of control, I can always move my Queen, followed by the Bishop back and out of harms way, if the situation is to arise."

Better was to retreat with 15.Bd5, and that way, if 15...Nxd5, instead of recapturing the N, I'd take on e7.  And, after those series of exchanges, I'd feel more comfortable with my position.  By playing this move, he'll prevent what I noted with his next move, but that's not all."
163,"
15... Rfe8 16. Be3",",? As here, I get too greedy and try to fork his Na5 and Qc7.  It's called being too happy about my position which as Ken noted in a recent annotation, I did the same thing against Tom Walsh which is another reason that I lost.  But, this is going to lose a pawn after Jack exchanges.  Better was 16.Bd5, and if Jack exchanges, it's not so bad.  As it would remain even, as opposed to losing a pawn and winding up with doubled pawns."

With that being said, I go now from comfortable to feeling very happy about my position and actually should be.  The reason being is that only one desicive mistake was made but not here.  And, with best play, in this position, the game should end in a draw, as Jack pointed out.  Believe it or not, that's how I'm thinking now as I am confident about the possibility about getting a draw.  In other words, that is my thought process starting now, and because of what Mr. Stockel said later on, I am correct here.  Of course, I know not to trust to your opponent, but it's a question of when he's right or not.  With this game, due to my thought process, I reckon that he's right.  In fact, my belief is that he is spot on."

151_1,"
24. Kf2 Re6",",?? Just like with what Jack has done, my goal was to double up in such a way that one of my Rooks is not cramped.  So, it's also about a good outpost, but this was the decisive mistake as Jack pointed.  As now, not only will he win a pawn, but this will give him a mating net that I overlooked.  After the game, we went over variations.  He said that my only options were 24...Re7, 24...Qd7.  Of those two, I like 24...Re7 the best because it allows me to double up with a later ...Re8.  Perhaps, even on the next move.  The point is that one of the major pieces had to be on the 7th rank to keep my P and K protected.  By playing this it's over.  So, after the game was over, we played through some variations right after 24.Kf2.  It involved black playing 24...Re7.  Yes, there was one mistake much later that lost with his passed pawn.  But, this is where my instincts (thought process) was verified.  For after, 24.Kf2, Re7, or 24...Qd7 if black plays everything accurately, it's, at the very least, a draw.  And, if white makes one error, black would, in fact, be able to win.  Of course, Jack wouldn't have made it, but I did have the opportunity to draw the game up until now.  But, that also shows that unlike some previous games, I had a very good reason to be happy about my position.  But, this blunder, it's game over, at once starting with his next move.  "

But, then he showed me his next move which is, indeed, checkmate.  And, that's when we went reviewed why on my 24th move, it was necessary to keep my R or Q on the seventh.  As it is the same rank where he got my pawn, and later the King.  As it turns out, one them would've guarded against what unraveled.  And, that became one of the main teaching lessons since we spent about 30 minutes studying what happens after 24...Re7 before starting the next game which I also lost with a back rank mate.  That's when he later reemphasized how important King Safety is.  And, there was, I believe, a 15 minute lesson before we had to pack up and leave."

15... Na6","This does continue with Dan's development.  However, just like a GM game that fiercequeen annotated, the N is, indeed, in the wrong place.  Thus, I would not have hesitated to play 15...Nd7.  What's worse is that even though, there is a little mobility with the R, whereas, we didn't see it before, it's still limited.  On the other hand, had Dan developed that N to d7, the R would be free to move about.  And, the reason I draw that conclusion is because of just how important mobility is.  In this context, I think it's even more important because of how compromised the other wing is.  In other words, the K side is blocked up, completely, so my thinking is why compromise the Q side, at all?  Methinks that this ensures white a win.  Although I did favor Joe's position, with this move played, I think that white now has a win."

Additionally, two of the others are not in a good spot.  So, that, immediately boils down to space advantage.  Now, fiercequeen said that it's not really about material advantage, but rather, it often comes down to space.  Well, I'd say that this is the case here. "

I don't just think so anymore, but this is where I just begin to realize that white definitely has a won game here.  It's not official yet, though.  As it's not, ok white only has this and that to do to win.  But, with the best, which happens with Joe, white has a won game.  The reason being is that this N is now one of the main pieces that's indirectly attacking black's K, as we will see towards the end."
18_1,"
18... Qc6 19. dxc5",",As this was one of the plans behind attacking the Q.  The immediate effect, of course, is that Dan recaptures to avoid giving away a pawn, after having had handed back a minor piece.  However..."
18_1,"
19... bxc5 20. Rh3",",!! By my books, this is a killer move right here.  Might not be worth two exclamation points, but I give it that because Joe adds another attacker to Dan's K.  So, things are unleashing here.  As now, this R will become very dangerous, as we're about to see.  It's still not quite easy, yet, but a win from white is closer.  In other words, it's a little bit quicker then what I thought earlier.  However, with best play from black, it still might take a while.  I was thinking before was that it might take over 20 moves, but I'm pretty confident that white can win, in about 10 moves."
18_1,"
20... c4",",?? Trying to get a pawn, and maybe, thinking of a different mating attack similar to what I mentioned earlier, Dan played this.  Of course, even though I was beginning to realize that white has a won game, it wasn't official.  In other words, that would taken, at least, 10 moves.  But, with this move, however, a win is near.  Much better would've been 20...g6 to force the N back. "
18_1,"
21. Rg3",",And, that's because of this move which is why I gave 20.Rh3 two exclamation points.  Black can hold the game a little longer with 21...g6, but after something like 22.Bh6 Bxh6 23.Nh6+, Dan is in a lot of trouble.  Or even something like 22.hxg6 Bxg6 23.Bh6, as now, black must do something to prevent a later Nh6+ where mate would not be far off.  So, after something like 23...Bd6 white can immediately play 24.Bg7+ which immediately wins back a R for B.  Or 24.Ng6+ which is a quicker and might be mate.  If not right away, it would be mate shortly after.  But, either way, black's position is hopeless."

The Black LSB having moved three times already, is being invited to make a fourth move to exchange itself off for the White one, which has just made its first move.  In effect White is offering a trade, with (four minus one equals) three tempi to sugar-coat the deal for herself.  There isn't much Black can do about it, neither, but fall in with the trade.  It turns out, though, that the absence of White's LSB subsequently tends to deprive White of a valuable attacking resource.  Black therefore has something to throw onto the bottom line to offset the 'lost' three tempi."

In the early 2000s the opening's popularity suffered after Vladimir Kramnik scored excellent results against it, so much so that even Kasparov gave up the opening after relentless losses to Kramnik.

115,"
2. Bb5",",Therefore, I stick to what I know and try to transpose this into the Spanish Opening, since as we know, it starts off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5.  Given that 1...Nc6 was played, I try to do that.  Now, if I really wanted to, I also could've played 2.Nf3 which did come into consideration.  But, I felt that it was better to try and put some pressure against Tom's Nc6."
115,"
2... a6",",This could still transpose into the Spanish Opening since after 3.Bb5, black often plays this move."
115,"
3. Ba4",",Therefore, I still try to transpose the opening since this is how white retreats."
115,"
3... Nf6",",But, this move, however, stops that since Nf3 is often played.  Well, this move prevents that.  This, however, is where I overlook something."
115,"
4. Nf3",",? That's because in the Ruy Lopez, after 3.Bb5, black often responds with the Berlin Defense.  And, after 3...Nf6, black often castles.  The idea is that after 4.0-0 if 4...Nxe4, white regains the pawn by centralizing his R with 5.Re1.  Well, I am thinking along that same line, but the timing is off, as this move loses a pawn without anything in return.  Better was 4.Nc3, and then after 5.Nf3 it becomes something similar to the Four Knights Opening."
115,"
4... Nxe4 5. O-O",",As noted, I became overly confident with the last move due to the timing being off.  As I was thinking along the lines of 6.Re1 to get the N.  But, Tom stops that by attacking my B.  And, I don't like the position.  Whereas, in a different game I exchanged because it was possible when I was low on time.  The difference here is that I'm not ready to exchange but don't have a choice."
115,"
5... Nc5 6. Nc3",",That's because the only other options were 6.Bb3 or 6.Bxc6.  Now, I overlooked 6.Bxc6 and didn't want doubled pawns on the Q side.  So, I played this.  Where I a little more careful, I would've captured on c6 to double up his pawns. "
115,"
6... Nxa4 7. Nxa4 b5",",As now, Tom gains tempo here."
115,"
8. Nc3 Bb7",",Which gives him a nice spot for his LSB.  And, as we will see which Tom notes in the end, this is starting to become a dangerous position for black because of where the B is placed."
115,"
9. Re1",",So, I try to become sneaky, myself, by centralizing my R."
115,"
9... e6",",But, Tom has an answer to that."
115,"
10. d3",",So, the plan is to complete my development.  10.b3 also came into consideration, but I didn't like the looks of 10...g6 as this allows 11...Bg7, to which, Tom would threaten my Ra1 or Bb2.  Therefore, I felt like it ought to be avoided."
115,"
10... Bb4",",The only problem is his pin on my Nc3."
115,"
11. Bd2",",So, similar to what we see when it's against the Q or K, I break it with my B."
115,"
11... Qf6",",Bringing his Queen into play.  At first, I thought that the purpose was to castle on either side.  But, as it turns out, Tom is going to have a dangerous threat that I'm bound to overlook."
115,"
12. Bg5",",Thinking that Tom might have brought his Q out prematurely, I attack it."
115,"
12... Qg6 13. Bd2",",? And, I keep my N free of the pin.  But, the B would've been better on g5, as this is where Tom's threat becomes nasty.  In fact, although I'm not quite lost yet, Tom now has a big advantage because in order to save the position, I will, at the very least be forced to destroy my pawn structures.  But, it'll only get worse as that's one of the main things that I'm thinking about."
115,"
13... Nd4",",I was really wondering what to do.  As noted, I'm forced to double up my pawns.  That's because of one variation that I considered which doesn't work.  That variation is what happens after 14...Nxf3.  At first, I thought that it was no big deal because of he did that, I'd take back with 15.Qxf3?? and everything is fine.  But, it would not be because of his Bb7 which means that I almost overlooked 15...Bxf3 leaving me a Q for a piece down.  So, I had to double, and then asked myself what I could do to get out of it.  Unfortunately, I made the wrong as there were multiple threats, but I only saw one being the loss of the Queen."

17. O-O",",At last, and quite understandable.  There will come times at this level of play in which quite complicated tactical situations can arise.  It is very hard to learn to recognise and take advantage of them without having begun with simpler, less complicated motifs and patterns.  The main thing to note is that the f7-knight is pinned by the bishop against the king.  It is defended by a rook and the king.  Could White heap another attacker against the pinned knight?  Yes she could: 17.Ne5!  Could Black in response find another defender?  Only the Queen.  What that means is that White looks to be winning the exchange after 17.Ne5.   ++++++++++++++  As it transpires, this might have led to a wild tactical melee as follows:  17.Ne5! Bd6!  18.Nxf7 Qe7ch (the reason for the bishop move) 19.Kf1 b4  (A piece and a pawn down, Black fights like a tiger to stay in the game) 20.Nh6ch! ... (As you see, this is well beyond 'one-mover' territory, and would be challenging for an experienced tactician to calculate.  Not 20.Nd6ch?? bxc4  21.Nxc4 Rxf2ch 22.Kxf2 Rf8ch  23.Kg1 Ne2ch and Black wins)  20...Kh8 21.Bd5 e6  22.Nf7ch Kg8  23.Qg4! Ne2 24.Be6 Rxf7  25.Rb1 Raf8  26.Bxf7ch Rxf7.  fen=""6k1/4qrpp/2pb4/1p6/p5Q1/8/PPnP1PPP/1RB2K1R w - -"" ++++++++++++++++ I would not expect anyone below Master level to calculate this whole line, so complicated it is.  Myself, I would have decided that something like 17.Ne5 b5  18,Bxf7ch Rxf7  19.Nxf7 Kxf7 won the exchange and left it at that.  I might well have been surprised by the tactical fight Black put up by 17...Bd6!  but 'them are the breaks'.   If you don't see a reason NOT to capture a thing, or win some other advantage, go for it.  If it turns out bad, you will learn to recognise the really unsafe captures. "

I thought that exchanging gained more since Charles is forced to take back.  But, this didn't gain anything.  In addition, this happened before the lesson with GM Susan Polgar about not exchanging unless there is a definite advantage.  So, I misunderstood a part of that message where Susan said that, in general, exchange N for B.  In a later lesson, she said that you sometimes also need the B, and thus, don't exchange so quickly.  And, that was when I had that chess dream as training from the lord.  He went over the same thing that Kenneth_fiore_3 told me.  So, what Ken said in our first lesson was spot on as that was, in reality, how I was thinking until those important lessons.

I then thought that this was just inconvenient, as I've allowed something that I did not desire which was an exchange here.  Shortly after, I thought that it was just the worst being a burden.  But, it's not.  As this is a mistake, being that Charles will win another pawn after exchanging.  So, much better would've been 17...Re8, afterall."

The only way to prevent me from winning back material would be 23.Rxe8+ and after 23...Rxe8, Charles must advance his h, g, or f pawn to prevent mate.

The best thing was just to accept the destroyed pawn structure, but even then, Tom is clearly winning.  And, I have to try and figure out what to do to save the position.

The results would've been the same either.  But, it would have been a transposition as this would've been played on the next move, as opposed to the other way around.  But, how I figured it out, is that I went to the original notes, V. the changes that I made.  This, is what was originally notated.  So, I went by that because the original is more accurate.  That's because with one move, it was all of the other changes that corrupted the position.  That is when I realize that accept for one move, I figured it out, and thus, picked from where I left off in the 5 day period. "

163_3,"
48. Ng4",",Another factor is that had this been played first, Jack's next move would've protected the same way.  So, it would've been 47.Nf4, Rc2 48.f4, Rdc7.  But, as I mentioned earlier, I went by what was originally notated (before that little change) to determine exactly how it was played.  For, right after Jack's next move..."
163_3,"
48... Rhc2 49. fxe5",",I take right here because of the threat on his d6 pawn and then some which is bound to become a reality.  That's not to mention that with it, it is also where I start to compensate for lost material and start to build from there."
163_3,"
49... Rc2c3+",",I knew that Jack one of his Rooks.  But, I also had a difficult time determining which Rook he used to deliver check.  But, after further studying which took an equivalent to an hour or two, I concluded that this is the Rook that he used.  And, you'll find out how I made that determination later on."
163_3,"
50. Ke4",",This is one of the very few times, where what I originally notated was incorrect.  The original was that 50.Kf4 had been played, instead.  However, this is the move that I made as it gives my Rd5 additional support.  The idea being is that a pawn with K and R all working together in the endgame is very dangerous."
163_3,"
50... Rc7c4+",",After the last check, it took me even longer to figure out which Rook Jack used to check again.  It took, at least, 2 hours.  But, I concluded the he used this Rook, as you'll find out soon.  And, that starts with the fact that this will be his last check for a few moves.  After starting to sort things out and in the process, this is was the hardest move to figure out from, what was, a corrupt position.  Since I was able to do it, that's when I realized that this is, most certainly, how the game was played."
163_3,"
51. Kf5",",With that, this move was forced."
163_3,"
51... h3",",With that Jack continues to push his passed pawn."
163_3,"
52. exd6+",",How I determined that 50...R7c4+ was played, as opposed to, 50...R3c4+ is one fact.  The reason being is because, as noted, Jack didn't check before this move.  With that, his Kce7 and one of his Rooks would be forked.  And, I would've taken advantage of that fork because after 52...Kd7, I would've played 53.dxc7, as opposed to, what unfolds.  The best part now is that not only have I leveled out the game, but I went from losing to now winning. "
163_3,"
52... Kd7 53. Rxb7+",",What unfolds is this move.  The reason behind it is because it wins another pawn.  Of course, I keep his next move in mind.  But, unlike before, the upcoming fork is of no concern to me thanks to my d6 pawn.  As it will have access to the promotion.  What that all boils down is the importance of mobility as emphasized by Ken in our second training game, as well as, what he mentioned in an annotation shortly after."
163_3,"
53... Kc6 54. d7",",With that, I keep pushing my pawn."
163_3,"
54... Rf3+",",In response, Jack holds off by checks this way.  And, this is where I determined that 49...R2c3+ was played, instead of 49...R7c3+  Had he checked on the seventh, it would not have been possible to check without losing material.  That's because instead of on f3 which is where it was, it would've on f2 which loses the N right away.  So, given that circumstance combined with the check that I delivered on d6 by capturing which was difficult, that's where I determined what unfolded."

29... Nxe1",",?? That was, taking his Rook at once.  And, with what I mentioned, nothing else came into consideration because the attitude that I don't normally have is that I have fully compensated for lost material and then some.  As I was as confident as you'd get which I have gone wrong with that attitude, but that doesn't include that is this obvious.  However, it might as well be that I missed the threat, for had I defended, the game would've remained unfinished because I was, pretty much, out of time to continue playing.  So, the truth is that I had less then a minute here as it was close to noon.  And, that's not to mention packing up and getting ready to leave due to my work schedule.  When the game was over, Jack was enraged with my play here.  And, he accurately pointed out that best was 29...Rg8  However, if I just had only one more minute, I would've seen the threat.  By playing this, it was over, at once."

What I overlooked is that I can last a little longer with 30...Kg8, but after 31.Rg3+, it's still a forced mate since the K must move back which allows 32.Qg7#.  It started off with an hour, but in the end no time remained.  Jack, who was enfuriated yelled and said, ""ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF WHY YOUR OPPONENT MADE THAT MOVE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT HE WANTS.  DON'T JUST ASSUME THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE, BUT ASK YOURSELF WHY HE PLAYED IT.""  That is an important lesson that GM Susan Polgar emphasized, and I have taught my students.  And, it seems so obvious, but it wasn't.  That's because right after my resignation, I had to get going, at once.  In other words, I had no more then 5 seconds to spare.  As noted, If time was on my side, I would've continued with 29...Rg8.  And, it would go as smoothly as it should be.  So, it's a good thing that it finished, as now, it's at least lost, instead of still in progress.  That's because if it doesn't finish, it remains that way as we don't resume.  Therefore, what there is to learn is actually what happened in the beginning where I blundered my piece, more then the threat that I would've seen with more time.  My take is that when a piece is threatened, you must ask yourself if they'll take with check or not.  Had I not been in check, my piece would've protected, as Tom would not have taken due to the Queen being in danger.  But, having gotten the check he had won a piece."

That's what where I thought it was.  However, that, I believe was ghost vision.  As yes, he has doubled pawns, but it's no of major asset since it's around the Q side, instead.  And, I also overlooked that my Nf6 is still pinned.  With those two things, the timing wasn't right which means that my judgement still needs fixing.  That's because once he takes back, Stanley will have better mobility with the center as he is breaking through which is something that one does not want to see. "

Had I spent a little more time, I would've seen this, and thus, taken on c4.  I think that getting too excited made me think like Turtose, as opposed to, the Hair, as I've mentioned.

I think what was lacking was any urgency to fully develop his pieces.  Instead of focusing on the white pawn that was effectively dead, White should have worked to finalize development sooner.  White moved his queen into Black territory twice, without a clear strategy and the second time it should have been maintaining defense.  When making forays into enemy territory, seek to use multiple pieces to have a sustained presence and threat.  Finally, you have to play defensively sometimes.  Don't move out pieces that are critical to defense and consider all potential moves on enemy attacks and understand when you have to trade, even if it's not to your advantage. Being ahead in points doesn't matter if you get checkmated."

In addition, while it's blocked for now, I know that sooner or later, ION will find a way to promote his f6 because I studied a similar example with Coach Stockel.

Following this game, he had a meteoric rise, winning the 1957 U.S. Open on tiebreaks, winning the 1957–58 U.S. (Closed) Championship (and all seven later championships in which he played), qualifying for the Candidates Tournament and becoming in 1958 the world's youngest grandmaster at the age of 15.

But, had I retreated with 4.Ba4 then would come something like 4...b5 5.Bb3, and after 5...Na5, I'm forced to exchange.  I'd rather exchange now then at that point.  That's because unlike the doubled pawns that Tom will wind up with, I don't want to allow doubled pawns on my side along the b file.  As that would be of an asset.  And, I didn't want to play 4.Bd3 as that blocks my center pawn.  In fact, I told my student, reachforgoals that it's not a good idea.  However, there's one move that I failed to consider.  So, instead of exchanging, I think that best would've been 4.Be2  As I also considered Bc4 and asked myself what would happen is Tom attacks 4...c6.  4.Bf1 also came into consideration, but I didn't want to undevelop my LSB which would make it difficult to castle.

So, there would not be an immediate advantage to playing 9.Bxf6, instead."

But, that's where I figured out that it was Tunnel Vision because of where the N is now placed, in contrast to, where I thought it was placed.  So, hyperfocus right on the f7 square which is why it's Tunnel Vision.  As I thought that I might have a mating sequence.  This would, however, be true if the N were on g5, and he didn't have the pan h6.  So, in disguise, it was a good thing that this Tunnel Vision was there, as otherwise, he might have compensated, and even wound up the equivalent to a pawn up as this would have been a free N.  "

That gives Jack only two options of either 60...Ka6 or 60...Ka8, but the next move would be the same.  And, that is 61.Qb7# which is also mate.  Therefore, black would get mated in all variations."
163_4,"
60. Qc7#",",After this game, Jack told me what happened.  First, instead of 54...Rf3+, we looked at what would happen if he forked before I promoted, so 54...Kc6  Black, however, would still be busted because of my a4 pawn since there is no way out of mate as he said.  For example, 55.d7 Kxd5 56.d8=Q+ Kc6 57.Qd7+ Kc5 58.Rb5#   But, as I thought that he made lucky blunders that allowed me to pull a swindle and win.  However, Jack said that the blunders that he made were not luck.  Instead, he allowed me to win because of my readiness to resign.  What he's emphasizing is something similar to what I see in TA's blitz Q sacs which is another reason I like studying them.  That is, don't resign so quickly, even if, you are at a disadvantage.  For, you don't know when you're opponent will go wrong.  I partially agree with him, especially with players at or below my rating.  But, I have doubts with players a lot stronger because ION, Ken, and reversion have all said that one should resign after getting a piece or higher, or when you feel that there is nothing left to learn.  That's what I thought against Jack, but he showed me otherwise which is why he has let his opponents win before.  However, another way of looking at it is not to trust your opponent.  So, one must decide whether to agree or not.  Normally, I would not and think of it as luck.  But, I don't here because after 47.f4, black did not capture with 47...exf4+  Had he done that, after 48.Kxf4, black is still winning and for the same reason being that my dangerous pawn is gone.  And, that would, in return, take away the opportunity to get back in the game.  And, after 49.fxe5, combined with the checks, he did not take back with ...dxe5.  Yes, I'd still get a pawn back but would, in return, lose the passed pawn which was used to promote and win the game.  So, him not taking back and allowing me to promote is what made me realize that there was no luck here.  And, that's because, in general, Mr. Stockel does not miss moves like that.  Therefore, the moral of this story is to not resign just because you feel that there is nothing left to learn.  Instead, keep playing, and only resign when the position hopeless against a stronger player.  So, as a new guideline I'll thinking of some of them similar to the Supplemental Talking the Talk (original WTW rules).  And, those rules state that one is not allowed to resign until a mate is proven.  That is, until the runner has a forced mating sequence. "

My thought was that if he is to take, I'll recapture.  So, I didn't trust, and was thus, sure that he wasn't going to grab my Bishop.

197_1,"
21. Qe3+",",With that being said, I resigned here because after 21...Kh5 which if forced, 22.Qg5# is mate.   After the game, we reviewed that and he asked me why I didn't take his Nh5 with 20...gxh5.  When I told him the reason, he said that, in the future, I'm gonna need to study the position a little bit more, just like in our first game.  The solution here is also taking a little longer to look at the position.  But, you will be shocked at what else develops.  So, capturing would've helped, but the positon was still lost for black due to my Queen being out of play.  That's when I remember to be a spectator of my own game, based on if I agree or see something different.  I usually agree, but in this case, I see something different.  With that, I don't completely agree with his assessment.  As I believe that 20...Kh6?? was the losing blunder, in it of itself.  For had I taken back, and Jack had taken back, I have made up for lost material and would have plenty to fight for.  Not only that, but his attacking forces against my King would not have been as strong.  So, there would've been a chance for me to get a draw.  But, by moving the monarch the way I did, black was busted because of what happened afterwards.  After this game, Jack went back to making a mistake, in which I got a piece, but moved a little quickly.  Then, I messed up in the endgame since I had to leave.  In doing so, it ended in a draw.  The moral of this story is what Jack and I discussed in the Men's Room while saying goodbye.  So, on top of taking enough time, he said that one the things that must come into consideration is the K.  And, that I need to watch out for it's safety.   I agree with him there since K safety is very important, as Jack Stockel has previously emphasized with this being the perfect example."

81_1,"
15. Bb5",",As my original play was an oversight.  The move was 15.Re1??  Forgetting that my Bc1 was not developed the idea was centralizing my Rook, whilst attacking his Queen.  But, with my B locked in that hope almost worked, as now, he would've equalized.  This is important because unlike here, if this were still the tournament, that would've been the final move.  And, it's not because there's not much time.  Instead, it's that once you've made that move, even if you see that it's a mistake, there's no going back.  Thus, I would've lost all of my advantage.  I'm only lucky here that it's not.  So, I took that move right once before he captured, so it was just before I saw what he was about.  That's when Tom reminded me to take my time which is what also needs work during the tournament.  The other move that I considered was hitting the Queen by bringing my Bc1 into play.  Problem is that I can't since that is keeping my b2 pawn protected.  It's also worth noting that for the obvious reason fianchettoing would be just as bad as Re1??, so that was not considered.  Not knowing what else to do, I decided to play it safe and protect my LSB. "
81_1,"
15... Qh5",",At first, I was surprised to see Tom play this.  But, I figured out why, and it turns out that this is a dangerous plan.  Again, it is Hope Chess as he's hoping that I would overlook the threat which would allow the threat, as afterall, I'm threatening to take on b6."
81_1,"
16. f3",",But, remembering what happened in my rated game against bhidragon, I take it very seriously.  As I had considered 16.Qxb6??  However, this is another reminder of where timing is important.  In this case, it involves what bhidragon told me which is seeing the big picture.  Another way of saying it is seeing everything that's occurring on the board in order to figure out what the position demands.  The idea being is that Tom was threatening a checkmate on me.  So, if I had captured on f6, he would've played 16...Ng4  After which, there would have been no way to prevent 17...Qxh2#  Additionally, no good would've been attempting to prevent the same move with 18.h3??  As after 18...Qxh3 Tom has gotten back a pawn, and the threat is renewed in almost the same way that I saw with bhidragon.  Since after a blunder, he had a crushing attack which started with Qh3  And, I used that same strategy in two games afterwards, so I am familiar with the pattern.  Afterwards, I could still delay 19...Ng4 with this move, but after 19...Qxg3+ white is still busted in a winning position.  So, this move prevents that trouble, as Tom's N can't just come in.  With that being said, what I also remember was Jack's lecture on just how dangerous the N's can be.  Well, this is a perfect example.    "

If it were stronger opposition, and not of equal strength, I'd probably resign right after losing the Rook.  But, this is further behind, and, therefore, there is nothing else to get from this game.  But, I guess that Tom doesn't feel this way."

22. Kg1 Be6",",Tom must have been worried that I would play Qf6-g4 followed by Bh6 where mate would be threatened, especially given that he would not be able to play ...gxh6 since it's pinned.  I was thinking about that line but since it prevents it, and even before that, I was asking myself what to do.  First, it is possible for me to take on d4.  So, that is my next move."

So, I decided to advance one of them.  I was then thinking that I would be, at some point, possible to bring my Bc1 into play.  And, even, Sacrifice my Queen for his Rook to promote.  As from there, it's a forced line.  So, I was thinking along these lines which involves several variations.  And, that's important to think about. "
81_1,"
25... Rd8",",?? But, this move, however, makes it very easy for me.  And, it is a forced win at once.  If the Rook weren't emprise, I'd ask what you'd play as otherwise it's a lot harder."
81_1,"
26. Qxd8#",",The idea is that even without mate, I was going to play this anyhow, as it wins a Rook at once.  In other words, there no need to promote or sac the Queen to do it.  However, I looked at it and it's even more then just winning the other rook which is also the reason behind it.  That's because I figured out that this is checkmate since Tom's back rank was unprotected.  I seized advantage of my opportunity and went for it.  It was an interesting game, but after Tom's double blunder early being a piece and then a Rook, I had the advantage and did not give it back.  In doing so, I was able to force the win.  But, what I learned here is that even with the win I still need to take my time.  That's because by moving too quickly, I almost gave up my advantage and allowed equalization being the general oversight where I almost blundered the R which would've happened in a tournament where there's no going back.  So, it is very important to be aware of that, as well as, remembering how important the timing is.  As the timing by one move made the difference between losing a pawn and getting a piece for pawn.  By holding off just one move, it worked out in my favor which is what allowed me to take advantage of the first blunder."

8... Ne5",",However, contrary to what I learned with Ken, this is a moment where I exchange just because it is possible to do so.  In other words, it's my readiness to do so.  And, although other things came into consideration, it's the time crunch.  For, had there been more time before noon (which is when I and others have to leave), I would've held off by developing my Bf8.  The problem is that with time being of the essence, my thought process is just absent.  As I didn't give this move a lot of thought, whatsoever.  Sure enough, my instinct about what's to come, as noted, is correct.  But, right now, white has an advantage.  For, the exchange means that I'm forced to double up my pawns.  And, I lose castling rights since 10.Qxd8+, with which, white is clearly better, despite it being even, material wise."

And, the B keeps the pawns more supported since it seems more passive.  Meanwhile, I continue my plan of getting the R's connected by breaking the pin, at once.  And, although white still has the advantage, I am, believe it or not, feeling more comfortable.  This time, it's not because of the position, but rather, I'm feeling comfortable that white won't be able to convert his advantage into a win because time is running out.  Let's see, we started off with 30 minutes, but now, there's only about 15 minutes left here.  And, I'm continue to make it difficult for white to keep his edge."

This wasn't just a blunder, but rather, Jack intentionally made it to see if I'd follow up with the right response.  It's very important to note, as he told when we were saying goodbye, that it took Mr. Stockel 10 minutes to find this move.  Thus, I should win easily.  How can white win?"
86_1,"
19. Rd7",",?? The logic behind that question is that I overlooked the right move.  And, when I did, Jack did his usual and embarrassed me in front of the other students.  He did this by going back the position right after the previous move (18...Qxe5) when the game was over, and then, asking the same question that I asked.  I am sure that his goal is not to embarrass people.  Instead, his goal is to teach his other students, as there is an important reason this mistake occurred and a lesson affiliated with it.  So, he wants his students to learn.  With that being said, the solution to the problem is 19.Bd4!  As now, with my Qg3 and DSB, I am threatening mate on g7.  Meanwhile, the Queen is threatened, and if Jack is to move that Q, he will get mated.  Of course, not moving it or bringing to f6 (which also prevents mate) will result in 20.BXQ winning the Queen for Bishop.  So, long and short, there would be no way for Jack to protect his Queen.  But, the reason I made this mistake is that, in the wrong context, I tried to apply what ION told me about short range tactics.  As there appears to be two attackers against one defender.  What I overlooked is that his Queen is on the same line as my DSB.  And, being that he captured the pawn which protected my Bc5, Jack can and will capture.  Thus, I am down a piece without compensation.  In part is because when Jack captures I will be in check.  There's even more then what it appears to be, though.  To make matters worse, as per what Ken has asked me before, besides this move, nothing else came into consideration.  The problem is what Jack directly stated to me.  Whereas it took him 10 minutes to find the previous move, it only took me 30 seconds to play this move.  That is exactly why Jack embarrassed me in front of the other students.  The idea was to teach them why you don't rush.  But, that is especially true for the tournament.   Instead of rushing, you should come close to or even use up your time (timeout, lose on time.)  What he told everyone and reemphasized to me is that you must take your time.  As rushing can and often does cause something like this to happen.  "

86_1,"
25... Rxe1+",",What I thought would work here was 26.Nxe1 Qf1+ Kg2  But, what I forgot is that 26...Qf1# is still mate, even with what appeared to be, a window open as Susan Polgar put it.  The other variation which I don't is not recapturing and playing 26.Kg2 (leaving me a R down to which things appeared safe.)  But, he'd mate the same way being 26...Qf1#  So, there's no way around it.  I saw that right after he captured.  Consequently, I resigned here.  As noted, when that happened, that's when Jack went back to what I should've played with the other students.  Then he reminded me of how important it was to take some time.  So, that was one of three morals to this game.  The other one is what Kenneth_fiore_3 has stressed in previous annotations which he directly stated with this game.  So, he told to remember that, ""When you see a good, look for something better.""  Remembering, though, what that ION said to sometimes play it when you see a good move, I mentioned why I thought it would work before realizing that the Queen was there.  That's when he said, ""Why bother with a piece.  Forget about it as you could've won.  Don't go for a piece when you can win the game.""  Out of the three morals, I'd say that the first one of taking your time is the most important one.  As this is what happened in some of my other games.  As I went much too fast to see that I could've won.   In fact, while we were saying good bye Jack told me that during those 10 minutes he said to himself that if I found the right move, I'd win.  And, if not, I'd lose, but he was hoping that I would find the winning move which didn't happen.  With that being said had I spent, not even one, but several (at least 5 minutes) I would've seen, and thus, played 19.Bd4!  After which, it would've been game over for Jack, at once."

6... Bxf3",",As usual, I asked myself what to do.  I didn't exchange just due to the important dream.  Before that, when I wasn't sure, if it were N for B, I'd exchange just because it was possible.  So, it was still being too readisome to do it.  Then, came a lesson with GM Susan Polgar at Polgar University 2017.  In a very small segment she talked about exchanging and said that even N for B doesn't mean you should exchange.  Instead, you should only engage in an even exchange when there is an immediate advantage.  Then came the dream, and that's when the lord said that I still need to change my thought process and not think that exchanging gets rid of my problems.  On top of what Ken said, that's also where I realize that Jack was wrong by advising me to exchange whenever possible against stronger players.  As Susan implied that being up against stronger opposition is even more of a reason to not just go into exchanges.  But, here, I asked myself what choice do I have.  For example, after 6...Bh5, which I considered 7.g4 Bg6.  Forgetting that the other N was exchanged, I had Ghost Vision and thought 8.Nf4.  Once again, I jumped the guns but there since in that situation, an exchange is forced, sooner or later.  My other thinking was that I didn't want to be forced to retreat to e6 where the center is blocked or move to d7 where it has less mobility.  And, I didn't want to undevelop my B to c8.  So, I thought that the best option was this move to prevent the worries.  Well, my assessment and thought process was wrong due to the Ghost Vision.  Had I remembered that one of his N's was exchanged and where it would go, my assessment would've been correct.  So, much better was 6...Bh5, as 7.g4?! and not only do I retreat to g6, but his K would, at the very least be weakened which favors black."
50,"
7. gxf3",",?! With that being said what I had expected would been best which is 7.Qxf3, as now, Ted's K side is weakened even more then what I noted earlier due it not just being advanced but having those doubled pawns.  That would be an asset if white is to castle later on."
50,"
7... g6",",Trying to find a good spot for my undeveloped B, I fianchetto.  It'll have better mobility this way then by advancing the e pawn.  That's because it'll cover more squares.

At first, I thought yes, but when I reanalyzed and saw where his K is, I determined that it's a no.  Unlike that game, Perry has only one move that he can make with his K, but it is not going to help which means that there is no escape here since it is, pretty much stuck in the corner.  With that, I played this as it forces an immediate win."

Well, we're seeing the same thing but in a different order.  So, it's certainly a transposition, and I believe that it is with the very same defense.  The real reason behind this move is because of what Carl wants to do."
137,"
5... b5",",As he was about to play 5...Nxe4  But, as noted, you have to think of this like a training game with Kenneth_fiore_3.  That's because Jack didn't allow Carl to capture on e4.  He said that taking there would be a mistake since white can answer with 6.Re1.  Afterwhich, I'd have the advantage.  Well, I don't completely agree that I'd get an initiative, but rather, I'd call it even since those moves have been played before.  In fact, cplusplus11 showed me an example, and I believe that game ended in a draw since it's all in book, and therefore, blends in theory.  With that being said, had he taken, I would've stayed in book by centralizing the Rook on e1.  Therefore, he told Carl to play this.  After which, as noted, it has transposed, and possibly into the Berlin Defense.  But, what I do is that this is interesting."

Similar to another game, I didn't know what else to do.  Therefore, without thinking twice about it, I just exchange.  And, yes, I am back to doing it just because it is possible to do so.  The problem to is that I didn't give this time, either.  As after Carl takes back, I will harass the Queen which is just something that I enjoy doing.  For, had I taken a little longer, I would've either fianchettoed with 9.b3, or I might have developed with 9.d3.  The thing, however, is that nothing came into consideration, aside from this move.  It was right here that I start becoming impatient.  I think the reason behind is that I was still upset about all of the insults towards TA that it took away all of my concentration.  This is also why after complaints were made, I made the personal prayer that GK would suspend that club which is what happened.  As those kinds of things and getting all upset after a club war or insults towards a good teacher and friend has gotten the best of me.  That is what happened here. "

But, the only thing that I was thinking about was preventing Carl attacking my Nf3.  The problem is that I was impatient enough to overlook that this wasn't possible because of my Nc3.  By doing this, the exchanges favors black.  And, I also didn't give mobility enough consideration because what happens here is very similar to what occurred with my second game against Ken.  With better mobility, black is going to win a piece with, at most, a pawn in return which also favors Carl."

The problem is that it does not fix my problems either."

And, I weighed it in with what I learned from GM Susan Polgar which is also something that Jack mentioned in a loss against Tom Walsh.  And, it boils down to what your opponent wants to do.  In this case, Jack wants me to take to allow the mate."

So I didn't really look at 3...dxe4 4. Ne5, thinking that 4.....a6 would refute it, and spent most of my time looking at 3....dxe4 4. Ng4, and all the complications of the Budapest Defence but with white having the extra move, which I decided to avoid. After the game my opponent showed me a trap, 3.... dxe4 4. Ne5 Qd4 5.

99,"
10... f6",",It's understandable that Ted didn't want to liquidate do to being a pawn down.  But, it was necessary here because this will remove his pawn on the weakest.  And, as we know, you must always be aware of the f2 and f7 squares as they're the weakest on the board.  Once they're gone, you're in trouble, as I've learned with TA's blitz Q sacs.  Well, I kept that in mind."

And, he was horrified that I played this move.  In fact, he asked me why I didn't play 14.Bxb7, and I told him that I was not ready to exchange.   Then, Mr. Stockel told me that this was a terrible move.  Now, Ted didn't know what to do.  But, Jack told him that the best move was capturing.  In it he said, ""Take the Bishop.""  The logic was that he'd win a piece.  I realized that this doesn't because, if he takes, I can recapture.  I'm sure that he was thinking of something else.  I agree that this move is a mistake because preventing the loss of a piece should mean that he equalizes."
99,"
14... Bxd5",",But, Jack asked me the same question that Ken asked me a similar question to what Ken asked me in our second game.  This time, it led to a worse mistake.  It was a blunder.  Jack said, ""Now what?  What are you going to do now?""  "
99,"
15. Qh5+",",?? I was originally thinking of 15.exd5.  But, asking that question made it seem like I was in trouble.  Therefore, I came up with a new plan.  My response was that I have to answer to that and checked this way.  He then asked, ""What's that going to do""?  I said that I was thinking about what happened when Perry played a bad move and allowed me to bring the Queen like this.  His response was, ""that's not going to work"", and I thought he was right because it shouldn't have..  What I was implying with Perry's move was the Domiano's Defense.  In the tournament game against Perry, I was white and he was black.  It started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6?! 3.Nxf6 exf6?? 4.Qh5 g6 5.Qxe5+ which allows white to win the Rook.  Well, after he asked me that, I thought that this variation might work and, as what I'm generally guilty of, got very comfortable and happy with my position.  That's because if black messes up, I will get the Rook and have a plan.  Luckily, it does work.  But, this move is a lot worse then the previous move.  His next move is a good example which turns it from just happy to Hope Chess where I hope that he won't see it which will allow me to achieve my goal.  It's also worth noting that after this move, while Jack looked at the game one more time, he didn't get involved any more because the remainder of his time was spent on the other game.   "

The King is being forced to move, which leaves him stranded in the middle of the board.  And to demonstrate the point that changing circumstances place different values on time, space and material considerations, White had a much better move than this check: 13.a4! This move is a bit harder to find, and its purpose a little obscure (force the Queen back, OR activate the rook after 13...bxa3 e.p.).  In fact I looked at the a4-move only in the context of a possible King hunt in the near future."

If you see what looks like a blunder, you can suppose that it is, but make no such assumption.  Equally: you can suppose the apparent blunder disguises something sneakily nasty.  But do not assume so.  I am reminded of an old US acquaintance (TS) domiciled in my own country telling me about his victory over a Grandmaster - Larry Evans, I think it was, or it might have been Sammy Reshevsky.  At about move 9, the Great Man left a piece 'en prise'.  Our friend, TS, simply could not, for the life of him, figure out the plot.  What dastardly scheme did the GM have in mind?  So TS simply took the piece.  'I guess we'll find out now,' he thought.  He found out, all right!  Having made a simple blunder, the GM promptly resigned.  It happens to us all.  With GMs, it is a rarity, but not at all unknown.   Here, Black had to play 17...Kc7 though the following King hunt ought eventually to have cornered him: 18.Rf5 ...

And, although not taught this by kenneth_fiore_3 what I remember from Yoga class is that one must be calm and collected.  In other words, it's about keeping the gaze still and mind quiet.  That's what it takes to become a better, as in the past, even after that game, I'd feel overwhelmed and cope with the Fight or Flight Syndrome which is quite bad as it has caused me to rush which resulted in terrible mistakes that shouldn't have been made.  It's about knowing how to handle that unfamilar territory as I learned with charleshiggie in his past annotations.  Keeping the guaze still and mind quiet means staying calm at all times.  Be it note that the reason for mentioning Yoga is that what I was wondering for years was how to handle the Fight or Flight Syndrome.  The bad part is that no coaching or mentoring game has helped me with that.  Instead, all of my questions were answered by going to the Yoga classes, over the past 2-4 years.  "

So, if I don't if there's anything wrong with it or not, I just assume that it's good move.  That's generally not a good way to go, though, because more careful analysis should be used.  It boils down to taking a little more time.  With that being said, if this game were played on GK, I would've taken more time and used analyze the board, which I'm spoiled by.  But, in OTB chess, I feel that I get a little careless due to feeling too comfortable, which is similar to what happened in my game with Ken.  I feel it's good and play with OTB games, rather then, giving it a closer look since I don't know what else to consider here.

I might wind up asking Susan Polgar how many variations at once to study because, in general, the most I analyze is 3.  I have a feeling that more then that would be needed.  As this is an example of me analyzing only one line.  The reason for exchanging was to prevent 10.Ne5  As not only do are my only options to exchange pieces or lose tempo, but Tom would have a nice pawn chain which I was determined to prevent because of what Susan Polgar said about this in a variation of the French Defense.  What I thought very shortly about but should've looked at deeper is what happens after 10.d5, Nb4  As I thought that Tom could get a discovered attack on my N by moving his Nc3.

This was similar except that it wasn't too GM's, but it's the first time I've seen it with strong players during a blitz game like this.  It doesn't matter, however, as Joe is about to give up his Q for a pawn in the usual way."

So, it's very important, even here."

In fact, it's out, just about, as soon as, what I saw with Botvinik when he played Fischer.  It can be argued, however, that Joe brought it out earlier since he gave it away.  But, white can get away with not following the principles because of who he's against.  However, opponents who are not as strong should at least follow some of the guidelines.  Not doing so can be a recipe for trouble.  And, that is often the case in games like this."

The plan is to break through and double up white's pawns on the b file where Joe would be forced to recapture away from the center.  After that, black can prepare for something like ...Qxa3+ with a devastating attack.  In fact, it would pretty much be a forced mate.  For example, 14...Qxa3 15.Kb1 Qxa2+ 16.Kc1 Qa1#   Instead, I would've played 13...Nd7, so that even after 13.h5, black has gotten another piece developed.

Had he not resigned, I would've played 47.Rb1 to keep his monarch confined to the a file.  Then, I would just keep pushing my f pawn until it promoted.  After the promotion, I would've checkmate on a8 with that promoted pawn.  Overall, I enjoyed how this game went, but it still shows that I need to work on my assessment.  This time, I gave Jack a ride to his house, as it was raining like cats and dogs.  But, while we were sitting and talking, Jack said that he was upset that I played 14.Nxe5  As first, one piece was hanging and then, I hung another.  Thus, I was too advanced to be making a mistake like that.  Well, he was wrong about my 14th move.  But, I made that very mistake on the 15th move.  Trying to treat it like a Domiano's Defense, left me with 2 pieces attacked.  I could and should've wound up the equivalent to a pawn down.  But, I got lucky that Ted blundered and allowed me to catch up on the game.  However, I'm gonna have to still work on my assessment as judging the position accurately is crucial.  A mistake has costed me multiple games, including two of my most recent games, both of which ended earlier today."

First of all this trade of the knight for bishop, while good, is not as good as it might be able to be in the future. The threat of the discovery is stronger than the execution. Also all the simplifications benefit white by trading down to a better endgame. Black really wants to keep some complexity in the position and trade in a more favorable way.

For the moment White has no real weaknesses, though c2 is likely to become one.  It can't really be said Black has any, neither.  White has a 3-1 majority on the K-side, the pawns are level, and the f-pawn is 'passed' - Black can stop its promotion only with pieces or the king.  This sounds good for White, but there is a down side: White will have to look to the K-side only to make progress, unless he can induce a vulnerable weakness on the other wing.  Black's advantage is in the flexibility - handiness - of his pieces.  Bishop, knight and rook work pretty well together.  I assess the game here as roughly level.

Jack: Why didn't you exchange with 22...Bxg4  Joe: I didn't want to exchange because that would liquidate further since I'm behind.  The idea is not exchanging pieces when behind.  Stanley: True, but there is a danger that you overlooked which is my N.  Jack: How many times must I tell you to be aware of the N?  Those Knights are very dangerous, and therefore, should not let them come in like this.  Stanley: Had you exchanged, I would've remained with the advantage, but black would've been ok.  By refusing it was game over for black.  "
