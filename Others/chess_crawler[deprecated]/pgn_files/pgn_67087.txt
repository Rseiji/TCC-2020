1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {I opened with the French Defense as Black.} 3. exd5
exd5 4. Nf3 Nc6 {Nowadays I always consult the game database in the opening
when I play here at Gameknot. That has increased my rating significantly.}
5. h3 Bf5 6. c4 Nf6 7. Nc3 Bb4 {Developing the pieces towards the center.}
8. Be3 O-O 9. Be2 Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 Ne4 {A Knight outpost at e4 is well placed
in the center.} 11. Qb3 Na5 12. Qb4 Nxc4 13. Bxc4 dxc4 14. Qxc4 {Maybe
better for White was Qxb7 clearing the b-file for Queen and Rooks? The
Black pawn at c4 is weak and difficult to protect and will probably soon
fall anyway!} Nd6 15. Qe2 Ne4 {Back at the outpost again!} 16. c4 c6 {An
alternative for Black was here 16...Nc3. But it will not lead to anything
because of lack of protection of Blacks knight!} 17. O-O {Still pretty
even.} Re8 {Occupying the semi-open e-file with one of my Rooks. Also nice
that the White Queen is at the same file, maybe it can lead to something?}
18. g4 Bg6 19. Kg2 {The position of the White King seems already a little
bit vulnerable?} Nc3 {Now it comes. But still without protection.} 20.
Qb2 Ne4 {The only good square for the Knight.} 21. Qxb7 {White is grabbing
a pawn suddenly. But was it sound?} Re7 22. Qxc6 {White is grabbing another
pawn.} Rc7 23. Qa4 Rac8 24. c5 Nc3 25. Qc4 Nd5 {Blocking the advance of
Whites both free pawns is necessary.} 26. Bg5 f6 27. Bh4 Bf7 {Threatening
Whites queen in the next move.} 28. Qc1 Nb4 29. Bg3 Rd7 {Blocking the pawns
even more. } 30. Qd2 a5 {An alternative, probably better move would be
Nd5.} 31. a3 Nd5 {Now Nd5 becomes  a necessity.} 32. Rfe1 Rc6 {Now the
blockade of Whites c-and d-pawns can`t be more efficient.} 33. Nh4 g6 34.
Rab1 Be6 35. Bd6 Bf7 36. Rb5 {Threatening the pawn at a5.} a4 {Advancing
temporary solves the problem.} 37. Ra5 {But only very temporary!} Nb6 {An
interesting move! If White takes the offered Knight, he will immediately
lose his Bishop at d6. Hard to say if this really was a good move by me?
IÂ´m dubious, but if rejected the possibility exists of a Knight fork at
c4 in the next move!} 38. Rb1 Nc4 {He falls in the trap.} 39. Rb8 Rc8 40.
Rxc8 Qxc8 41. Qb4 Kg7 {Disaster! I missed my chance to take White Rook
at a5 with my Knight!} 42. Rxa4 {To try to compensate for my missed opportunity
I forced myself to think really deep!} Rb7 {Chasing away my opponents Queen
away from the important task to protect the Rook!} 43. Qe1 Qc6+ {Check!
White will lose his Rook in the next move because of this fork!} 44. Nf3
Qxa4 {Takes the Rook for free!} 45. Qe4 {Threatening my Rook. Probably
...Qb5 would have been a good defensive move here, or first trade off with
...Nxd6 ?} Qd7 {??? Very bad 'protection move'! Misses totally pawn fork
c6! My second very bad move in this game in a short time.} 46. c6 Qxd6
{Trying to get the best out of the situation!} 47. cxb7 {Now I also must
defend so that pawn b7 not will go in Queen. A bothersome task.} Na5 48.
g5 Qb8 {Blockade.} 49. gxf6+ Kg8 50. Qe7 Nxb7 {At least I get rid of the
very dangerous White pawn at b7.} 51. Ng5 {White is threatening mate in
two.} Nd6 {Try to defend as good as I can.} 52. d5 Bxd5+ {A pawn for free!}
53. f3 Qb2+ {Counterplay.} 54. Kg3 {Disaster for White! A winning fork
at f5 will follow! With correct play I think it would have been drawish.}
Nf5+ 55. Kg4 Nxe7 56. fxe7 Bc6 {White gave up here.}  0-1
