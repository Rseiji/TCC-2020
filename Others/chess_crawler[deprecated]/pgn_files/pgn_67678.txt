{An exciting game that I figured deserved annotation. After a fairly blocked,
complex opening, White eventually develops a menacing attack on the kingside.
After initially missing a chance to gain a large advantage, White gets
a big chance to eventually mate on the queenside. Despite a late rook sacrifice
to force a draw, White could have still won through the right moves, however
crucially slips, and can only come away with a draw.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 Bc5 5. Bc4 O-O 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 d6 8. Nc3 Nd4 9. O-O Qd7
{Now Black's pawn island becomes separated. 9...Nxf3+ would have been easier,
where 10. Qxf3 would have met with 10...Bg4, gaining tempo and maintaining
control of the centre.} 10. Bxf6 gxf6 11. Nd5 Qd8 12. c3 {Trying to drive
the pesky knight away, but taking with the knight may have been simpler;
still, White retains his small advantage.} Ne6 13. b4 c6 14. Ne3 Bxe3 15.
fxe3 b5 16. Bb3 Ng5 17. Nh4 Kh8 18. Qh5 Kh7 19. Rf2 Rg8 20. Bxf7 {The first
important moment of the game, where White misses the obvious pin on his
pawn, to which Black takes advantage of. 20. Kh1 was safer, eliminating
Black's next move and keeping the pressure on. Now a fork comes.} Nh3+
21. Kf1 Bg4 {Here Black figured he had trapped the Queen, but misses a
gross oversight. 21...Rg5 was the best move, driving the queen away and
eventually taking the exchange afterward, Black would have a slight advantage.
Now White's attack develops in spades.} 22. Bg6+ Kg7 23. Qxg4 Nxf2 24.
Kxf2 Kf8 25. Qh5 Rh8 26. Bf5 Rg8 27. Qxh6+ Ke8 28. Bg6+ {White is trying
to get his bishop into the attack, but its job at f5 covers important territory
that it was not necessary to leave its post. 28. Qh5+ was strong, and against
perfect defence White's attack is powerful. Black gets a break here. }
Kd7 29. Nf5 Rh8 30. Qg7+ Kc8 31. Ne7+ Kb7 32. a4 Qd7 {Black doesn't like
the idea of a discovered check on his Queen, but now makes a mistake that
could cost him. 33. axb5 cxb5 34. Bf7 would have more impact, as White's
rook will eventually come into the fray, and Black is stuck and lost.}
33. a5 {White makes a bad error here, instead of going for the aforementioned
33. axb6. If Black goes 33...Rag8 it will be defeated by 34. bxc6+.  Now
if Black goes 33...Rag8 he will cause White all sorts of problems and neutralise
his attack. However....} Rxh2 {?? - Black decides to go for a desperate
attack, and thinks the lone a-file rook will defend along the back rank,
however now will lose at least a rook and almost lose here.   As mentioned
before, 33...Rag8, almost trapping the Queen, then 34. Qxg8 Rxg8 35. Nxg8
will give White at least decent compensation for the queen, with a fairly
trapped position will make it difficult to make progress.} 34. a6+ Kb8
{34...Kb8 runs into 35. Nd5+. 34...Kc7 loses also to 35. Nd5+ Kb8 (35...Kd8
36.Qf8 Qe8 37.Qxe8#; 35...Kc8 36. Bf5) 36. Qf8+ Qc8 37.Qxd6+ Qc7 38. Qxc7#.
} 35. Qf8+ Kc7 36. Qxa8 Rxg2+ 37. Kxg2 Qg4+ {It was this move Black had
been planning on for a draw, and White in any case will force mate if Black
runs out of checks. If White can get cover behind the barrage of pawns
and get across to the queenside, he will win, however, White missed his
opportunity. } 38. Kf1 {Now Black forces the draw. 38. Kf2 forces Black
to push away to 38...Qh4+ and White will eventually escape to the Queenside
and eventually force mate.} Qf3+ 39. Ke1 Qxe3+ 40. Kf1 Qf3+ 41. Kg1 Qe3+
42. Kg2 Qe2+ 43. Kh3 Qf3+ 44. Kh4 Qf4+ 45. Kh3 {Certainly not 45.Kh5??
Qg5#.} Qf3+ 46. Kh2 Qf2+ 47. Kh1 Qf3+ 48. Kh2 Qf2+ 49. Kh1 Qf3+ 50. Kg1
Qe3+ 51. Kg2 Qe2+ 52. Kg3 Qe3+ 53. Kh2 Qf2+ 54. Kh1 Qf3+ 55. Kh2 Qf2+ 56.
Kh1 Qf3+ 57. Kg1 Qe3+ 58. Kg2 Qe2+ 59. Kg3 Qe3+ 60. Kg2 Qe2+ 61. Kh1 Qf3+
{Draw Agreed. White won't escape the checks. However, Black escapes a loss.
}  1/2-1/2
