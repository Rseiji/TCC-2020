1. e4 {I am including this, as my shortest loss in a competitive match.
I was only 19 at the time.} c5 {I played The Sicilian Defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence}
2. Nf3 {He plays the main line} d6 {And so do I} 3. d4 {He opts for the
open variation.} cxd4 {I take} 4. Nxd4 {He takes back.} Nf6 {I attack his
e pawn.} 5. Nc3 {He defends} Nbd7 {At the time I was playing this quirky
variation. I usually followed it up with an attack on the e pawn with a7-a6,
b7-b5-b4 to drive away his protector of e4, combined with Bc8-b7 and Nd7-c5,
all attacking e4. Unfortunately one of my friends at University eventually
demonstrated how a timely f2-f3 by white stops black's plan.} 6. Be3 {He
develops.} a6 {I start my plan.} 7. Be2 {He continues to develop.} b5 {So
I continue with my plan.} 8. Nd5 {What is this? He seems to be offering
me his e pawn.} Nxe4 {Patzer sees a pawn, patzer takes a pawn. } 9. Nc6
{Oops! Black loses the queen, so I resigned. Thanks for reading this, please
leave a comment or two, and score it on the star system so I know how I
am doing. Until next time dear reader!}  1-0
