1. d4 {I was playing for Sheffield University 2 in the BUCA (British University
Chess Association). I can't find out much more about my opponent. He seems
to have played in the British Under 18s in 1974. He doesn't seem to be
still playing. This BUCA tournament was held in Edinburgh. I think it is
the only time I played in it, I think the other years Sheffield University
only enter one team, who actually won it a year later in 1977. This is
from round 4 and the only game I still have from the event. I scored 2.5
out of 5 overall.} f5 {He plays the Dutch Defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Defence}
2. Bg5 {This is basically a cheap reply, hoping for h6 3.	Bh4	g5 4.	Bg3
f4 5.	e3	I wouldn't play it now - I don't think it is any good.} g6 {But
he doesn't fall for that.} 3. c4 {So I develop} Bg7 {And so does he.} 4.
Nc3 {Aiming for e2-e4} Nf6 {Delaying it} 5. Qc2 {With the same idea.} c6
{At the time I thought this was a bit passive and I still do.} 6. e4 {Carrying
out my plan. I am already out of my databases - Nf3 or 0-0-0 or e3 are
the only moves I can find for white in this position. I still think there
is a certain logic to the move though.} d6 {This seems passive. Fritz prefers
taking on e4. } 7. f4 {Hoping to continue with e4-e5. This is very aggressive.
Fritz prefers Nf3 or exf5} O-O {Fritz is still preferring black to take
on e4.} 8. e5 {So I continue to advance. Fritz likes this move, but only
gives the position as level. At the time I thought I had an advantage already.
Fritz now likes for black 8...Ne4 9. Nxn4 fxe4 10. Qxe4 Qa5+ and black
has enough compensation for the pawn.} Ne8 {But instead black retreats
and Fritz gives an advantage to white.} 9. Nf3 {Sound development move.
Fritz gives this as second best after Rd1} Qc7 {Fritz doesn't like this
move, preferring Nc7 or h6} 10. Bd3 {White develops. Fritz likes this move.}
a6 {Fritz prefers Na6 of h6} 11. O-O {His last move rather put me off 0-0-0
as he is ready to play b7-b5. Fritz likes this move. White is +0.66 now}
e6 {Fritz likes this move.} 12. h3 {I am not sure why I played this. Fritz
doesn't like it.} c5 {Not a great fan of this move either.} 13. d5 {But
my silicon friend likes this.} dxe5 {I give up a pawn, knowing that it
is worth it to get rid of his best placed piece his Bg7} 14. Nxe5 {I take.}
Bxe5 {He takes.} 15. fxe5 {I take back.} Qxe5 {He takes.} 16. Rae1 {I attack
his queen.} Qd4+ {He throws in a check.} 17. Be3 {My bishop drops back,
attacking his queen. Just look at the position! Black is a pawn up, but
his only piece in play is his queen, which is vulnerable to attack. At
the time I knew I had adequate compensation. Fritz confirms this, and give
white as over plus 2 now. } Qg7 {Queen drops back} 18. dxe6 {I take} Nc7
{he wants to take back with the knight to protect his pawn on c5} 19. Bxc5
{So I take while I can.} Re8 {His rook was attacked.} 20. Nd5 {Another
piece into the attack} Nc6 {He develops.} 21. e7 {Past protected pawn on
the 7th rank - can't be bad.} Nxd5 {He takes.} 22. cxd5 {I take back.}
Nb4 {Forking bishop and queen. if I take it, he was a queen check on d4
winning the piece back.} 23. Qd2 {So I let him take the other bishop} Nxd3
{Which he does} 24. Qxd3 {I take back} b6 {He attacks my bishop} 25. d6
{I ignore the attack} bxc5 {He takes.} 26. Qd5+ {But he is losing a piece
back. If Be6 27.	Qxe6+	and d6-d7 is coming.} Kh8 {So he tries this.} 27.
Qxa8 {And I take the rook.} Qd4+ {He throws in the check} 28. Rf2 {I block}
Qxd6 {He takes a pawn} 29. Rfe2 {I protect the e pawn.} Qd7 {Perhaps planning
Qb7 or Bb7} 30. Qf3 {My queen runs away} Bb7 {He attacks my queen} 31.
Qc3+ {I throw in a check} Qd4+ {and he throws in a counter-check.} 32.
Qxd4+ {I take} cxd4 {He takes back} 33. Rd2 {and this pawn is going.} Be4
{Ending my protection of e7} 34. Rxd4 {I take} Rxe7 {He takes} 35. Rd6
{I attack} Ra7 {He protects} 36. Red1 {Hoping to force a rook exchange}
Kg7 {King comes over.} 37. Rd7+ {Check} Rxd7 {He takes.} 38. Rxd7+ {I take.}
Kh6 {He avoids more checks.} 39. Rd6 {I attack the pawn again} Bb7 {He
comes back to defend.} 40. b4 {I start my queenside pawn advance.} Bc8
{He is just passing time. We both make the time control, move 40.} 41.
a4 {Continuing the queen-side pawn advance} Kg7 {One final mistake} 42.
Rc6 {He is losing the bishop, and with it the game. Thanks for reading
