1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian Defense.} 2. exd5 {The Lasker Variation of the Scandinavian
Defense is far and away the most popular response.  This will be followed
by either Qxd5 or Nf6. } Qxd5 {With the queen in the center of the board
white can develop pieces by pushing her around, such as Nc3.} 3. Nc3 Qa5
4. Bc4 Nf6 5. d4 Nc6 6. a3 g6 7. h3 Nxd4 {This just seems like a bad mistake.
 Knight for pawn?} 8. Qxd4 Bg7 9. Bxf7+ {White's 'bad trade' is only slightly
improved by breaking black's castle.} Kxf7 10. Nf3 Nh5 {This is the 'knight
to the rim' move that prompted me to annotate this game.  The black knight
wasn't under threat.  White's c knight could attack it, but black still
has a pawn, bishop, and king backup.  The purpose of this move was to launch
a surprise attack on the queen.  If white ignores this threat she falls.
 But before you push a piece you should know where it will go.  In this
case the white queen must guard the c knight, or black plays BxNc3+ and
white ends up losing at least the knight.  if white interposes the bishop
black gets the poison pawn (b2) for free too.  If white plays bxBc3 black
plays QxNc3+ and snags Ra1.  So white must be careful about where to place
the queen.} 11. Ng5+ {White delays response by countering with a knight
attack.  No interposing here, and black can't play Kf6 to attack the knight.
 Black is pretty much pushed back, trapping the h rook. } Ke8 12. Qc4 {White's
choices were largely limited to Qc4, Qd3, or Qe3.  I'm always wary of lining
a rook or queen where it can be pinned against the king, though Qe3 would
be pretty safe.  The drawback with Qe3 is that it blocks white's black
bishop.  Qc4 is good.  Black has a queen on Ng5 and could develop by pushing
it, maybe, but knows white is eyeing Qf7+.  Not that this would help white
much, but the only protection for Bg7 is that rim knight, which is easily
shoved by g4.  Therefore black is wise to guard against Qf7+.} Rf8 13.
Be3 b6 {That is a blunder.  Qc6+ gives white Ra8, though black's queen/bishop
assault on Nc3 still threatens white's rooks too.} 14. Qc6+ Kd8 15. O-O-O+
{And this move was what prompted me to post about this game in the Team
Captain forum.  Not quite O-O-O#, but O-O-O+ mate in one is still awesome.
 We were looking for something along the lines of the Edward Lasker/George
Thomas game, which SHOULD Have ended with O-O-O#.  As this game is NOT
in GK's database I'm providing an outside link to it here: https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1259009}
