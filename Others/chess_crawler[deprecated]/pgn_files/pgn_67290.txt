{I decided to once again try out the Rice Gambit as a mini-tournament.
It certainly leads to... interesting games. } 1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3
g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ne5 Nf6 6. Bc4 d5 7. exd5 Bd6 8. d4 Nh5 {The starting position.
} 9. O-O O-O 10. Rxf4 {Now that both players have castled, the complications
can begin. } Nxf4 {Obvious...} 11. Bxf4 {...and the logical response. }
Bxe5 {Black attempts to simplify.} 12. Bxe5 {Seizing the diagonal is a
higher priority than un-doubling my Pawns. } f6 {Black blocks the diagonal.
} 13. Bg3 {A logical retreat.} b5 {An attempt to decoy my Bishop off its
present diagonal. } 14. Bb3 {I don't bite. } Bb7 {Applying pressure to
the advanced Pawn. } 15. Qxg4+ {Countering with an attack. } Kh8 {15...
K-B2 might have been better. } 16. Qe6 {Guarding the advanced Pawn. } Re8
{Trying to drive the Q. } 17. Qf5 {I'm still guarding the advanced P. }
Qd7 {Oops. } 18. Qxf6+ {Gaining material with tempo. 18... Q-N2 is the
best reply. } Kg8 {This mistake... } 19. d6+ {...enables this deadly discovered
check. Black can only avoid mate by giving up ruinous amounts of material,
so Black resigns. }  1-0
