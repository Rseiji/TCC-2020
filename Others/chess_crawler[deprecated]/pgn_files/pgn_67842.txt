{A short game where a single blunder allows my opponent to overrun me,
and I miss an obvious mate. But what's curious is the analysis, which shows
the position as 'book' just before my demise. I'd always thought these
positions were labelled such because they were so common. Very curious.
Anyway...} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {The Two Knights Defence. In
essence, Black gives up a pawn for what can sometimes be a surprisingly
sharp attack.} 4. Ng5 {'A duffer's move' - Tarrasch. 'There is no other
way for White to try for an advantage. 4.d3 is tame.' - Fischer} d5 5.
exd5 Na5 {5...Nxd5 can be rather perilous for Black.} 6. Bb5+ Bd7 {Black
does not follow the main line of 6...c6 7.dxc6 bxc6 8.Be2 h6.} 7. Qe2 {This
seemed good at the time, but I am not so sure now. Black cannot take the
Bishop as 7...Bxb5 8.Qxb5+ c6 9.dxc6 looks rather dangerous! But I end
up exchanging anyway, so maybe a more straightforward move is better.}
Bd6 {Defending the e-pawn and getting his final minor piece out.} 8. Bxd7+
Qxd7 9. c4 {Again, it seemed good to try to hang on to my extra pawn, but
maybe castling or 9.Nc3 is more usual.} h6 {Black drives away my Knight,
a move usual in this opening.} 10. Nf3 {Now the attack on Black's pawn
is back on.} O-O {He's hoping I take it for after 11...Bxe5 12.Qxe5? Re8
and the Queen is pinned.} 11. O-O {Now I have my extra pawn and my King
castled, but my Q-side is undeveloped and Black has time and space for
a K-side attack.} e4 {Revealing an attack on the h-pawn by the Bishop while
attacking my Knight.} 12. Nd4 {But the Knight can easily escape.} Ng4 {Doubling
the attack on the h-pawn. But really, this is all bluster, less dangerous
than it looks. What can Black do after 13.h3? 13...Nh2? 14.Rd1 and Black
has nothing. 14...Nf3 15.Nxf3 exf3 16.Qxf3 maybe? But I get alarmed by
this build up of pieces and try something tricky and very foolsih...} 13.
Ne6 {My thinking was that Black can attack my Rook, but I will be attacking
his...} Nxh2 14. Nxf8 Rxf8 {Actually, this gives me a moment of possible
escape, while 14...Qg4 is dangerous.} 15. Rd1 {Now I get greedy. Giving
up the Rook while simply developing... 15.Nc3 Nxf1 16.Kxf1 and Black has
his pawn back but not much more. But I overlook a deadly attack...} Nf3+
{Opening up my King's defences.} 16. gxf3 {Clearly, 16.Kf1 is better; Black
gets to play 16...Qg5 but I have some semblance of a defence left. Not
enough, but something. This is catastrophic...} Qh3 {I could see the check
on h2, but thought Black had nothing better - and was trying for - a draw
by perpetual check... 17.Qxe4 Bh2+ 18.Kh1 Bg3+ 19.Kg1 Bh2+ etc. Wrong.}
17. Qxe4 {Bizarrely, the computer analysis has this as a 'book' position.
But how can it be? For now Black has a forced mate, one which I quite missed...}
Bh2+ 18. Kh1 Bg3+ 19. Kg1 Qh2+ {How I missed this obvious move I cannot
imagine.} 20. Kf1 Qxf2# {From a book position to mate in four moves. Strange
indeed.}  0-1
