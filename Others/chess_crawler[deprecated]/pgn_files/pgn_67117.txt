1. d4 {This was the first Shropshire match in the county championship for
years! I was lucky as my opponent had an 'off' day, after playing the opening
badly he mistakenly grabs a pawn that he would be better advised leaving
alone, and pay a heavy price very quickly!} Nf6 {My first match for Shropshire
in the County Championships. I was board 5.} 2. c4 {Conventional so far.}
c5 {Heading for Benoni type structures.} 3. d5 {I advance.} b5 {He plays
the Benko Gambit.} 4. cxb5 {I take.} a6 {he offers the second pawn.} 5.
Nc3 {I protect the pawn.} axb5 {He takes.} 6. Nxb5 {I take back.} Qa5+
{I think this is inaccurate. More usual is  Ba6 7. Nc3 transposing into
main lines (1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5 4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 Bxa6 6. Nc3)
reaches exactly the same position.} 7. Nc3 {Forced.} Bb7 {I prefer Ba6
here, taking control of the f1-a6 diagonal} 8. Bd2 {Indirectly protecting
d5.} e6 {Attacking it again.} 9. e4 {Protecting it again, and developing.}
Qc7 {Qb6 is the usual move here, preventing white's next.} 10. Qb3 {Protecting
d5 and also eyeing Bb7} exd5 {He takes} 11. exd5 {I take back.} Qe5+ {He
throws in a check.} 12. Be2 {I block.} Bxd5 {He takes.} 13. Nxd5 {I take
back.} Nxd5 {Of course, if he takes with the queen, I exchange queens then
Bf3 wins.} 14. Nf3 {I develop with tempo} Qe6 {The queen drops back - of
course it has to continue to protect the Nd5.} 15. Ng5 {I attack the queen
again.} Qe5 {Queen comes forward.} 16. f4 {Fritz prefers 0-0, but by this
stage white is winning easily - plus 3 after 0-0 or plus 2.88 after 16.
f4.} Qd6 {Queen drops back.} 17. Bf3 {Now the Nd5 is doubly pinned!} Qe7+
{He throws in a check.} 18. Kd1 {Now with the threat of Re1 as well as
the threat to his Nd5 he resigns. Fritz prefers 18. Kf1(+5.25) to this
move (+5.13) but it is rather academic. I avoided 18. Kf2? as then black
can escape with 'only' losing a pawn and exchange with 18.....c4 and if
19. Qxc4 Qc5+ 20. Qxc5 Bxc5+, but better is 19. Qb7(+4.81 according to
Fritz). Many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two, and rate
the annotation on the star system. Until next time dear reader!}  1-0
