1. e4 {This was played in our Club Championship. Although Steve is not
in our club he very kindly stepped in to make the numbers up when someone
dropped out. As the player with the lower grade he had choice of colours,
and opted for black.} c5 {He plays the Sicilian Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence}
2. Nf3 {I opt for the open variation.} d6 {The usual move.} 3. d4 {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence#Open_Sicilian:_2.Nf3_and_3.d4}
cxd4 {He takes} 4. Nxd4 {I take back.} Nf6 {Attacks the e pawn.} 5. Nc3
{Defends the e pawn.} g6 {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Dragon_Variation}
6. Be3 {The usual reply. If now 6...Ng4? 7. Bb5+} Bg7 {But now he is threatening
Ng4} 7. f3 {So I prevent it.} O-O {He castles} 8. Qd2 {I develop.} Nc6
{He develops.} 9. Bc4 {Making the freeing move d6-d5 harder, although sometimes
black plays this advance as a sacrifice.} Bd7 {He develop his bishop.}
10. O-O-O {I castle.} Rc8 {10.....Qa5 and ....Rf-c8 is another way of handling
the position.} 11. Bb3 {My bishop drops back.} Ne5 {Preparing to play Nc4
at some stage.} 12. Kb1 {Moving the king to a safer square.} Re8 {Played
to preserve the Bg7 from exchange, should I play Bh6} 13. h4 {Starting
my king side attack. I later came across this game https://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13740750&amp;rnd=0.12024436965985097
and the Gameknot post-game computer analysis gives it as a mistake. However
I also see now that this is in fact the most commonly played move, so I
wonder about the strength of that computer!} h5 {He stops further advance
of the h pawn.} 14. Bh6 Nc4 {Knight comes to c4 as planned.} 15. Bxc4 {I
take.} Rxc4 {He takes back.} 16. Bxg7 {I take his bishop.} Kxg7 {He takes
back.} 17. Nd5 {I throw my knight forward.} e5 {This move looks strange,
giving him a backward d pawn, but I found later on the opening databases
that this is the most common move in this position, and the most successful}
18. Nxf6 {I take.} Qxf6 {He takes back} 19. Nb3 {And my attacked knight
drops back. I am attacking his d pawn now. Re6 seems to be the most commonly
played move here for black, and also the most successful move.} Rc6 {This
is also given as a mistake in the computer analysis of this game https://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13740750&amp;rnd=0.12024436965985097
which recommends the counter-attacking Rec8.} 20. Na5 {I attack the rook.}
Ra6 {This is also given as a mistake in the same post-game analysis, with
Rc7 being recommended. } 21. Nxb7 {So I take} Qe6 {Be6 was played instead
in the above mentioned game.} 22. b3 {I protect against mate with Qxa2
followed by Qa1 #} Bc8 {He attacks my knight.} 23. Nxd6 {I take.} Rd8 {He
attacks it again.} 24. Nf5+ {I think this was the move he missed} gxf5
{He takes.} 25. Qxd8 {I take} fxe4 {He takes.} 26. Qg5+ {Rather than taking
back immediately, I throw in a check.} Qg6 {He blocks.} 27. Qxe5+ {I take
with check.} Rf6 {Oh dear, that is a horrible self-pin} 28. fxe4 {Exchange
and three pawns up, what more could I want?} Bb7 {He targets my e pawn}
29. Rhf1 {I target his rook.} Bxe4 {He takes.} 30. Rxf6 {I take.} Bxc2+
{He throws in a check.} 31. Kc1 {I calmly move my king, and in this position
black calls it a day. Many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or
two, and rate the annotation on the star system to let me know how I am
doing. Until next time dear reader!}  *
