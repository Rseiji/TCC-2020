1. d4 {I was pleased with my play in this game. The fun starts when I sacrifice
a knight for two pawns. I gain a third pawn then sacrifice the exchange
and then a pawn to keep his king on the run!} Nf6 {The match was played
on board 1 of Division 3 of the Chester &amp; District League. In our previous
encounter he had beaten me with white - my only loss this season in this
Division - so I am doubly pleased to win!} 2. c4 {Rhyl &amp; Prestatyn 2 won
the previous encounter 3-1 and we won this encounter 3-1. Division 3 Tuesday
10th March 2020 Rhyl &amp; Prestatyn 2	Vs	Malpas &amp; Oswestry 2 1	Mohammed Ayad

King's Indian or Grunfeld?} 3. Nc3 {So let's see!} Bg7 {King's Indian it
is! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence} 4. e4 {I take
the centre.} d6 {The usual move} 5. f3 {I play the SÃ¤misch Variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence,_S%C3%A4misch_Variation}
Nbd7 {Arguably already an inaccuracy, and possibly better (and certainly
more common) is 0-0. As played he never castles.} 6. Be3 {I develop.} b6
{Again, 0-0 is better. This is very passive, and on b6 the b pawn blocks
the d8-a5 diagonal in some variations. 6....b6 has been seen before though.}
7. Bd3 {I carry on with my development.} c5 {He puts a pawn in the centre.}
8. Nge2 {I protect d4} h6 {He said after the game he wanted to stop my
bishop going to g5, but this is another inaccuracy. Better is 0-0 although
white has an edge in this position.} 9. Qd2 {Now he can't castle without
losing his h6 pawn.} cxd4 {He takes.} 10. Nxd4 {I take back.} Bb7 {He develops.}
11. O-O-O {Played after a lot of thought. Fritz is preferring b3 with virtual
equality.} a5 {Fritz prefers Rc8 with a slight edge to black.} 12. Kb1
{Fritz prefer Ndb5 with equality.} Rc8 {Fritz agrees with this move.} 13.
Be2 {And with this one!} Ne5 {And with this.} 14. b3 {and with this.} Nc6
{Fritz prefers Ne-d7 with a slight edge to white.} 15. Nd5 {Here I was
thinking that the game would continue with Nxd5 16.	cxd5	Nxd4 17.	Bxd4
Bxd4 18.	Bb5+	Kf8 19.	Qxd4	 with a slight edge to white. Fritz here like
Ndb5} Nd7 {This is a move that Fritz considers but eventually preferring
Nxd5} 16. Nb5 {Fritz likes this move.} Nc5 {Fritz likes this move. OK what
would you play here as white?} 17. Nxe7 {Would you play this? I analysed
the three ways that black could take. 17.	Nxe7	Nxe7 18.	Nxd6+	Kf8 19.	Bxc5
and then Nxb7 recovers the sacrificed piece with massive advantage. 17.
Nxe7	Qxe7 18.	Nxd6+	Kf8 19.	Nxc8	Bxc8 gives white a slight material advantage
- two knights sacrificed for rook and pawn.  Fritz doesn't play 17. Nxe7
but I think it is clearly best.} Kxe7 {But there is this way of taking
back. Fritz does think this is best, although gives this position as equal.}
18. Nxd6 {Fritz likes this move.} Rb8 {Fritz likes this move.} 19. Bxc5
{Fritz likes this move. I can't play 19. Qd5 immediately as black has the
defence 19....Ne5 I played 19. Bxc5 with a certain degree of reluctance
and some thought - I didn't want to give up my lovely dark squared bishop
- clearly my good bishop - but it is the best move.} bxc5 {He takes back.}
20. Qd5 {Forking pawns on f7 and c5. Fritz likes this move. I had 'seen'
this position in my head when I sacrificed on e7 on move 17 and concluded
that getting a third pawn for the piece would be at least good enough.}
Nd4 {Fritz like this move.} 21. Qxf7+ {And this one.} Kxd6 {That move was
forced!} 22. Qxg7 {And I have to recover some material.} Qe8 {This is a
move that Fritz considers, but eventually prefers Qg5. Find white's move
here.} 23. Rxd4+ {Fritz agrees with this move - after some thought!} cxd4
{He takes back. What would you play here as white?} 24. c5+ {This is far
better than the obvious 24. Qxd4+} Kc6 {Fritz agrees that this is the best
move for black too. What now to keep white's attack going? White is still
materially down and must be active before black develops his pieces to
good squares and takes over the initiative. } 25. Qf6+ {Fritz looks at
this and agrees that it is better than Qxd4, but Fritz finally settles
on Rd1 or Bc4.} Kc7 {Forced as Kxc5 leads to him being mated with Rc1+
etc and Kd7 loses his queen to Bb5+. Fritz gives this as plus 3.94 to white
now. And what now?} 26. Qd6+ {Keep checking! Fritz likes this move.} Kc8
{Forced again. What now?} 27. c6 {Did you find this? Another pawn sacrifice
that black cannot accept. 27...Qxc6 28. Rc1 wins the black queen and Bxc6
28.	Ba6+	is also winning for white very easily.} Qd8 {Black is lost, this
is a reasonable attempt, hoping to get the queens off and escape to an
ending when he has rook for bishop and two pawns.} 28. Qe6+ {Fritz prefers
taking the bishop with check, but both win easily.} Kc7 {Forced again.}
29. cxb7 {Fritz prefers 29. Rc1. I looked at 29. Rc1 but didn't play it
as I was concerned about the reply 29....d3 but Fritz points out that this
can be met with 30. Qe5+ winning. Now white can meet 29....d3 with 30.
Qc4+ and 21. Bxd3. Nevertheless Fritz thinks this is the best line for
black, leaving white 'only' 2.44 up.} Kxb7 {But black takes here. What
now?} 30. Qa6+ {Fritz likes this.} Kc7 {Forced. What now?} 31. Qa7+ {Fritz
agrees this is best.} Kd6 {Fritz thinks this is best.} 32. Qxd4+ {Fritz
agrees this is best, and gives the position as plus 7.34 for white.} Ke7
{Fritz thinks Kc6 is better, but in either case it is hopeless.} 33. Qg7+
{Fritz agrees this is best and agrees black's position is resignable, which
is exactly what black did in this position. Many thanks for reading, please
leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system, so I know how I
am doing in these annotations. Until next time dear reader!}  1-0
