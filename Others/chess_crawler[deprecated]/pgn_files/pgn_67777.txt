1. d4 {I was very pleased with this result. I was playing a young (born
1998) Spanish FIDE Master on Lichess. I am playing and running sides in
the 4NCL Online. My opponent, Antonio Ruperez Benito https://ratings.fide.com/card.phtml?event=22245049
is board 2 for my 1st team. We were having a practice game at the usual
4NCL time control, 45 minutes each plus 15 seconds.} e6 {He offers a transposition
to the French Defence} 2. e4 {Which I accept.} d5 {and we reach the usual
starting point for The French Defence} 3. Nc3 {I play the main line} Bb4
{The plays the Winawer Variation: 3...Bb4  This variation, named after
Szymon Winawer was pioneered by Nimzowitsch and Botvinnik, is one of the
main systems in the French, due chiefly to the latter's efforts in the
1940s, becoming the most often seen rejoinder to 3.Nc3, though in the 1980s,
the Classical Variation with 3...Nf6 began a revival, and has since become
more popular. 3... Bb4 pins the knight on c3, forcing White to resolve
the central tension. } 4. e5 {Which I do} c5 {He attacks the base of my
pawn formation. } 5. a3 {I attack his bishop.} Bxc3+ {He takes.} 6. bxc3
{I take back.} Qa5 {He attacks c3. A well-known move in this variation,
although Black most frequently plays 6... Ne7 (The main alternative is
6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7, but
Black also has the option of 7.Qg4 f5 or ...f6. 6...Qa5 has recently become
a popular alternative) and I have met it before.} 7. Bd2 {I protect} Qa4
{He blockades my a pawn} 8. Qb1 {With a threat, Bb5+} Nc6 {which is easily
met.} 9. Nf3 {I develop.} c4 {He closes down the position.} 10. Be2 {I
develop.} Nge7 {So does he.} 11. h4 {I gain space on the king-side.} b6
{I find this move slightly puzzling. Is he preparing to develop his Bc8
to b7 or a6? I had my first real long think here. Afterwards I found out
that it had been seen before. It is on the Lichess opening database. It
was seen in Nagy, Bence (2361) v Szelenyi, Norbert (2350) which also ended
in a draw. https://lichess.org/cARnRgBJ} 12. Ng5 {This is what I finally
played. I am hoping to induce either g6 or h6 in order to be later open
up files on the king-side.} h6 {He attacks my knight.} 13. Nh3 {It drops
back to this square, keeping the f pawn free to advance.} Bd7 {He continues
to develop.} 14. f4 {I advance.} O-O-O {He castles on the queen side. Queen
side castling is quite common in the Winawer variation, for instance 6...
Ne7 7. Nf3 Bd7 8. Bd3 c4 9. Be2 Ba4 10. 0-0 Qa5 11. Bd2 Nbc6 12. Ng5 h6
13. Nh3 0-0-0. Its assessment is unclear, but most likely Black would be
considered 'comfortable' here. Perhaps the most famous Winawer game in
the 20th Century, Robert Fischer - Mikhail Tal, Leipzig Olympiad 1960,
had Fischer castling King side and Tal castling Queen side and eventually
black forced a  draw by perpetual check. Black can also castle king side
in some Winawer variations.} 15. Nf2 {My knight drops back. I did think
of playing Nf2-d1-b2 attacking his Qa4} Nf5 {Threat Ng3} 16. Bf3 {Easily
met} Rdf8 {planning f6} 17. g4 {I attack his knight} Nfe7 {It drops back}
18. Qb2 {I prepare to castle, as the centre is about to open up.} f6 {according
to plan.} 19. exf6 {I take. I didn't like the look for him taking. If I
take back with my f pawn I lose my Bf3 and if I take with the d pawn I
always have to watch out for d5-d4 by him.} Rxf6 {He takes back. I was
wondering if he may take with the pawn and play for e6-e5, but he has a
different plan.} 20. O-O-O {I castle.} h5 {He sacs a pawn.} 21. gxh5 {I
take.} Nf5 {Knight returns.} 22. Rdg1 {I grab the semi-open g file.} Be8
{He attacks h5} 23. Rg5 {I protect.} Rfh6 {He attacks it again. OK find
white's next move.} 24. Bxd5 {Did you find it? I was quite pleased at eventually
finding it after a long think. I was looking at 24. Rxf5 exf5 25. Bxd5
and wondering if I had enough compensation for the exchange and then I
realised I could play the moves in another move order.} exd5 {He takes}
25. Rxf5 {I take} Rxh5 {He takes.} 26. Rxh5 {I take} Rxh5 {He takes} 27.
Ng4 {Heading for e5} Bd7 {He attacks the knight} 28. Ne5 {Drops into e5}
Nxe5 {He takes} 29. fxe5 {I take} Bf5 {With pressure on c2} 30. Bg5 {I
protect the h pawn, freeing up the rook} Kd7 {Black offered draw with was
accepted. Perhaps slightly cowardly of me not to play on. The obvious plan
is to play 31. Rh2 followed by Qb4, but I thought it unlikely that I would
beat my highly graded opponent in the opposite coloured bishop ending.
Fritz does give white the advantage of 1.19 and recommends Rf2. Thank you
for reading my annotation. Please leave a comment or two and rate it with
the star system so I know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!
