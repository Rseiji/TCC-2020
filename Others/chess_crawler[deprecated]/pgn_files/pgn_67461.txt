1. d4 {Hi everyone!  It looked as though I was going to lose the endgame
hands down, but would a Removal of the Guard tactic change the result?
 Do read on.} c5 {1. ….. c5 - an unusual move by Yours Truly - usually
I play into the QGA and get mixed results.} 2. d5 f5 {2. …… f5 - curiouser
and curiouser.} 3. Bg5 Qb6 4. Nc3 g6 5. Na4 Qa5+ {5...… Qa4+ - now I bring
Glenda out fairly early doors.  However, it does result in white moving
his knight twice to block the check.} 6. Nc3 Bg7 {6. …… Bg7 - out of this
craziness a normal developing move at last!} 7. Bd2 Nf6 {7. …… Nf6 followed
by another!} 8. e4 d6 9. Bd3 O-O {9. …. 0-0 - the sanity remains with me
putting Henry safely on the kingside.} 10. Nge2 Qd8 11. exf5 Bxf5 12. Bxf5
gxf5 {12. …… gxf5 - had to weaken my castled position.  Hopefully I will
not pay for shattered kingside pawns.} 13. Nf4 Rf7 {13. ….. Rf7 - prevents
fork on e6.} 14. O-O Na6 15. a3 Nc7 {15. ….. Nc7 - almost my last piece
leaves my first rank and this prevents a knight invasion on e6.} 16. Re1
Kh8 17. Qf3 Ng4 {17. …… Ng4 - trying to ward off any frontal attacks to
my king's position.} 18. Qh3 Bd4 {18. ….. Bd4 - attack!} 19. Re2 Rg7 20.
Qd3 Qf8 21. Nb5 {21. Nb5! - this move floored me!  My knight on c7 is en
prise and if I take the b5 knight along comes that dreaded fork.  If I
move Glenda to defend the knight then I will still fall for the fork! 
I find a combo though that seems to be the least of all the evils!} Nxb5
22. Ne6 Qe8 23. Nxg7 Bxg7 24. Qxf5 Nd4 {24. ….. Nd4 - after a crazy passage
of play we have a knight fork!} 25. Qxg4 Nxe2+ 26. Qxe2 Qf7 {26. ….. Qf7
- after the dust has settled I find myself a pawn to the bad.} 27. c4 Bxb2
28. Rb1 Qg7 29. Bf4 Bxa3 {29. …… Bxa3 - Fou Lenoir at least prevents white's
outside pawns from being passers through capture.  Unfortunately I will
go back to being a pawn down in the next few moves.} 30. Rxb7 Qa1+ 31.
Qf1 Qf6 32. g3 a5 {32. …… a5 - I now push up my own passer.} 33. Qe1 Bb4
{33. ….. Bb4 - there is no saving the pawn on e7 so Fou Lenoir gets out
of the line of my passer and defends it and attacks the WQ at the same
time.  Alas, it does not prevent the e7 pawn from falling but at least
he has to capture it with his queen first.} 34. Qxe7 Qg6 {34.... Qg6 with
the idea of bailing out with a perpetual check on b1.} 35. Bxd6 Re8 36.
Be5+ Kg8 37. Qg7+ Qxg7 38. Rxg7+ Kf8 {38. ….. Kf8 - the WB is en prise
but my position looks still lost now being 2 pawns to the bad.} 39. f4
{39. f4?? - This move proves to be a gross error which will turn the game
immediately in my favour.  He should have played Bb2 or Ba1.} Rxe5 {39.
…. Rxe5! - this turns out to be the removal of the guard.  No matter what
black does I will be a piece up on the next turn.  If he saves his rook
I save mine, if he takes my rook, Henry will take his.  What a turnaround!}
40. fxe5 Kxg7 41. e6 {41. e6 - so he advances his passers but no worries,
Henry will put a stop to that nonsense by playing Kf6 on the next turn.}
Kf6 42. g4 {42. g4 - a valiant attempt at counterplay but I have worked
out that my a pawn will get to Glendadom before anything gets to it!} a4
{42. ….. a4 - so, my little Christian soldier, onward to Glendadom you
go!} 43. g5+ Ke7 {43. …..Ke7 - I do not take the poison pawn on g5.  I
work out that he will bring down his h pawn but this will be way, way too
late.} 44. h4 {44. h4 - nacht!} a3 {44. ….. a3 - double nacht!} 45. h5
a2 {45. …… a2 - this is just ace - only one square to go for that footman
that was in so much danger some moves ago.  Best of all Glenda when she
appears has complete control of the a1-h8 diagonal and if white leaves
his king where it is then Glenda can also land in a handy check.} 46. g6
a1=Q+ {46. ….. a1/Q+ CHEECK! Now because white must move his king I can
now start a clean up operation.  I now exchange my h7 pawn for white's
g6 pawn.} 47. Kg2 hxg6 48. hxg6 Qg7 {48. ….. Qg7 - Glenda will remove white's
g6 pawn on the next turn and then mop up all the other white pawns before
turning to the bog standard K+Q v bare king wrap up.  White finally accepts
this awful reality and waves the white flag.  Wheew and double wheew!}
