1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It is high time I did an annotation.  Haven't done
any since my cancer diagnosis (had my 3rd round of chemo today). Feeling
a bit more up to doing a few more.  This game meanders into the late middlegame
with both sides playing solidly.  I try another mating attack but it gets
rebuffed.  This game ends with me trying to checkmate him with Glenda and
my rook but he uses his queen as a get out of jail free card and Henry
cannot avoid her checks - sssss and double ssss.  Well, we will all get
to see how this comes about.} e5 {1. ……. e5 - each side is willing to play
a king pawn ending.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {3. ……. Bc5 - Guicco Piano.}
4. c3 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. b4 Bb6 {6. …… Bb6 - Fou Lenoir is driven back by
a pawn stab.  However, he still attacks f2.} 7. O-O O-O 8. a4 a6 {8. ……
a6 - ensuring that I keep Fou Lenoir bearing down on f2.} 9. Nbd2 Ne7 10.
Bb3 Ng6 {10. …… Ng6 - Sir Lollabout comes over to cover the kingside to
defend but to possibly attack the kingside at a later date.} 11. Nc4 Ba7
{11. …… Ba7 - I still want to keep Fou Lenoir thank you!} 12. a5 h6 13.
Be3 Bxe3 14. fxe3 {14. fxe3 - I end up doubling my opponent's kingside
pawns as a result of this exchange.} Be6 15. Nfd2 Qe7 16. h3 Nh7 {16. …….
Nh7 - Sir Slugabout moves to a7 because I smell the risk of Luca exploiting
a possible overload combo on the squares f6 and h6.  It does open the d8-h4
diagonal for Glenda as well.} 17. d4 exd4 18. exd4 Nh4 {18. ….. Nh4 - I
had been considering Bxh3 - a bishop for pawn sac.  With this knight on
h4 this sac could be a bit stronger due to the fact that Glenda can hop
onto g5 and eye up g2.} 19. Qe2 Qg5 20. Nf3 Nxf3+ 21. Qxf3 {21. Qxf3 -
foiled - but I will not give up!} d5 22. exd5 Bxd5 23. Qf2 Rae8 {23. ……
Rae8 - 'bout time I brought my big guns into action!} 24. Ba2 Nf6 25. Ne5
Bxa2 26. Rxa2 {26. Rxa2 - bishop trade.} Re7 27. Re2 Nh5 {27. …… Nh5 -
threatening a fork on g3.} 28. Kh2 Qf6 29. Qe1 {29...….. Qe1 - declines
queen trade.} Qd6 {29. …… Qd6 - pins knight on b8-h2 diagonal and threatens
f6.} 30. Qh4 Nf6 31. Kh1 Rfe8 32. Ref2 Re6 {32. …… Re6 - suddenly the knight
on f6 looks to be under pressure.} 33. Ng4 Nxg4 34. Qxg4 {34. Qxg4 - knight
trade and f7 is under the hammer.  I bring back my rook to e7 to defend
it.} R8e7 35. Qh5 Qd7 {35. ….. Qd7 - and Glenda yet again earns her sobriquet
Glenda the Defender.  But hopefully not too long!} 36. Qf3 c6 37. Qg3 Qe8
38. c4 Re4 {38. ….. Re4 - still attacking though - I just cannot resist
it can I?} 39. Qd3 {29. Qd3 - Ah Luca!  Now you can do some defending for
a change!} f6 40. Rd2 Re1 41. Rxe1 Rxe1+ {41. ….. Rxe1+ - rook trade.}
42. Kh2 Re3 43. Qf5 Qb8+ 44. Kg1 Qg3 {44. ….. Qg3 - threatening Re1+ winning
Q for R, but now Luca gets a Get out of Jail Free card with Qc8+ and a
draw offer which I accept.  At least this draw gave me another sojourn
in the 1900s from 23.11.19-13.1.20!} 45. Qc8+  1/2-1/2
