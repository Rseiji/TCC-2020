1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. exd5 exd5 5. Be2 {Not the most aggressive
way to play and black gets equality soon.  Bb5 ch is the reply that seems
to occur most often.} Nf6 6. O-O h6 7. d3 {Again a bit passive, d4 EARLIER
is probably better as it makes Bg5 with a pin possible and threatens to
isolate the black d pawn.} Bd6 8. Re1 O-O {Getting out of the way of a
discovery ( even if its's not possible now. ) } 9. d4 {Now d4 seems a little
late and black can either play b6 or c4 to avoid the isolated pawn} c4
{This starts an attempt to apply a cramp } 10. c3 Nc6 11. Be3 Bf5 12. Nbd2
Qc7 {Both sides are finishing their development.  I thought white might
try b3 here to force cxb3 and relieve the cramping effect of the black
c pawn.} 13. Nf1 Ng4 14. Qd2 {Giving up the bishop doesn't seem best, Bd2
or Bc1 followed by h3 and bringing the bishop back later should be OK.}
Nxe3 15. fxe3 {Of the three ways to recapture this was the one I didn't
expect.  The black's light square bishop will find a home on e4.} Rfe8
16. Nh4 Be4 17. Ng3 {This drops a pawn and makes the bishop on e4 a monster.}
Bxg3 18. hxg3 Qxg3 {The knight is hanging so } 19. Nf3 Re7 20. Rf1 Rae8
{Black wants to put pressure on the backward pawn on e3.  Ne1 for white
looks like it could allow white to play Bf3 but It would lose the e3 pawn.}
21. Rae1 Bg6 {This was played in part to prevent the white knight from
moving. If it goes to e5 white will drop both the d and e pawns. Any other
knight move drops the e pawn.} 22. Bd1 Bd3 23. Rf2 Re6 {Considering Rg6
and starting to pressure the kingside.} 24. Ba4 {This makes sense as white
wants to plant the knight on e5.} Be4 {It may be time to trade off the
minor pieces and focus on the e pawn.} 25. Bxc6 bxc6 26. Ne5 f6 27. Nf3
{The knight couldn't stay on e5.} h5 28. Nh2 h4 29. Rf4 f5 {Played to prevent
Rg4 or even Ng4. It also gives black the option of Rg6 to put pressure
on g2} 30. Qf2 Rg6 31. Re2 h3 32. Qxg3 Rxg3 33. Rff2 Bd3 34. Rd2 Rgxe3
{Black finally picks up the backward pawn.} 35. gxh3 Rxh3 36. Kg2 {chasing
the rook and trying to bring the king into play.} Rh6 37. Nf3 {Trying to
get to e5.} Be4 {not yet the pin won't let it go yet.} 38. Kg1 {This doesn't
really break the pin } Ree6 {Threatening the check g6.  Which doesn't lead
to mate ( unless someone can help me out ). But white trys to prevent it.}
39. Ne5 Rh1# {Mate!  It's easy to miss things in a blitz game.}  0-1
