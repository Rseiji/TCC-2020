e4 {Tolush-Geller gambit} b5 6. Be2 {I wanted to venture off with this
simple move instead of the main move e4-e5} e6 7. e5 Nd5 8. O-O Be7 9.
a4 Qb6 {And here I analyze Ne4 but thought it didn't amount to any advantage
and no path per se... } 10. Nxd5 {Time clock remainder: 1 hr. 53 min} exd5
{Pawn diamond! Black's time: 1hr. 44min.} 11. axb5 cxb5 12. Qc2 {hmm fair
move? I deployed my queen to prevent Bf5 development. } Nc6 {!  Double
attacking d4} 13. Rd1 {Here I was at crossroads with Be3 or Rd1. } O-O
14. h3 {prophylaxis! yes I was planning Be3 but I spent a little too much
time on this move. I passed the move to Black} Bd7 15. b3 {?! Time remainder:
1hr. 27min} Rab8 {Black's time: 1hr. 23min} 16. Be3 {Maybe should I played
on move 13?} Rfc8 17. bxc4 bxc4 {It was here I realized that my Be3 was
X-raying his queen and saw Bxc4 with pawn d4-d5 Of course, it doesn't work
here with my queen on c2 with his Rook on c8. Where to place my queen I
thought. } 18. Rdb1 Qd8 19. Rxb8 Rxb8 20. Qa2 {Time: 1hr 1min} Qb6 {Time:
1hr 8min} 21. Bxc4 {! And here I thought it was time to maneuver a combination.}
dxc4 22. d5 Qb3 {I believe my opponent acted real confused and played this
very hastily. } 23. dxc6 Qxa2 24. Rxa2 Bxc6 {it has here I pondering way
too long on Rxa7 or Nd4. Obviously, Rxa7 is better but I spent a good chuck
of my time between these to moves Nd4...Bd5; Be4; Bd7; Be8 were all possible.
I don't think Bb7 or Ba8 were candidate moves.  So 25. Nd4 with tempo...Any
bishop move;  26. Ra7 with tempo...Bc5 with tempo! Oh where does my Rook
go to? And here I was lost in the forest of variations after Black gains
a tempo I was lost.   I spent too much time on this. Way too much. I believe
I spent 14-16 minutes on this move.} 25. Rxa7 {Time 38mins} Bd8 {Time:
1hr 4min} 26. Ra6 {After accessing the rank was protecting by both bishops
I moved back a rank.} Be8 {So here I notice my opponent didn't like complications.
Even earlier He never ventured off with Nc6-Nb4 to attack my queen....}
27. Nd4 c3 {And here I used bad time management. I seen Nc6 as a candidate
move but couldn't calculate Black's replies Nc6...Rb1+; Kh2...pawn c2 and
dark square bishop has several squares to travel to with pawn c2} 28. Ra3
{??} Rc8 29. Nc2 {?? I felt very shaky about my position about here compared
to earlier} Be7 30. Ra7 {time: 10 min. I need to reach move 40 to get 30
additional minutes. } Bc5 {!!} 31. Bxc5 Rxc5 32. f4 h6 33. Kf2 Rc4 34.
Ra8 Kf8 35. Ke3 {It was here I had less than 5 minutes} Ke7 {Black's time
was 40-45 min. remaining. } 36. g3 Bc6 37. Ra7+ Ke6 38. Kd3 {And here Black
used a great deal of his time which went down to 23 minutes approximately
} Bb5 {!! winning move?} 39. Ke3 Kd5 {!} 40. Ra5 Kc5 {It here I errored
any miscalculated the opposition. It was here I bet that I could prevent
c3 from queening while creating my own passer with Pawn f4-f5 with Pawne6
to follow.} 41. Rxb5+ {Moves 30-40 where played very brash as I was under
time pressure. so feel free to leave any plans I missed.} Kxb5 42. Na3+
