{Protecting the e6 square 3 times while it's attack 3 times. It was here
where White thought for a while and used a good chunk..} 19. Ne4 Nxe4 20.

we played.} 37. Kf3 Kf8 38. Ke4 Ke7 39. Rf2 {Here we played it out...But
moves 39 are wrong I believe. White developed a passer on the c-file and
h-files but they were both guarded. We exchange rooks somewhere. And I
had a pawn dual Pawn-e5 &amp; Pawn-f5 that I kept intact and didn't dare move
them.  I won his Pawn-f4 somehow.  I offered a draw but white refused.
And we played 'til White and I calculated he couldn't promote his passers
on c7 and h4/h5 not sure which square it was on. opposite colored bishops.
 The pawn dual acted as buffer and prevented White from infiltrating. To
me it reduced a lot of calculating. } a6  1/2-1/2
