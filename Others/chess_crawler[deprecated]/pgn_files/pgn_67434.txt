1. d4 {That's a standard opening move, so it's good. You want to control
the centre of the board and this also allows your black bishop to move
out. } d5 {That's the standard response. } 2. c4 {That's a little unusual.
Most people would move the king's pawn out or perhaps a knight. } dxc4
{I thought I might as well take it. } 3. Nf3 {That's a good move. You want
to get your knights and bishops out at this stage. } Nf6 {So I'm doing
the same. } 4. Ne5 {One rule of thumb at this stage is not to move a piece
more than once. You're trying to get all your pieces out into the middle.
You would be better off moving out the other knight or a bishop. } e6 {This
will allow my bishop to come out. } 5. Nxc4 {Ok, fair enough. You've moved
that knight three times now, so you're behind on 'development'. } Be7 {Out
comes my bishop. I can castle now. } 6. e3 {Not bad, your white bishop
can come out now. } Nc6 {I'm getting my other knight out, which is what
you should be doing at this stage. } 7. h3 {That's a good defensive move.
It stops my knight going to g4. } O-O {I have castled. In most games you
will want to do this to protect your king. } 8. Nba3 {Ok good, your other
knight is out. } b6 {My idea is to put the bishop on b7 next. } 9. Nxb6
{Oops, a mistake. You've gained a pawn, but now I can take your knight,
which is much more valuable than the pawn. } cxb6 {Got your knight. } 10.
Nb5 {I guess that's ok, but you should focus on getting your other pieces
out. } a6 {Threatening the knight. I want it to back off. Knights make
me nervous when they're too close!} 11. Na3 {It's back where it was, so
you've wasted time. } Bb7 {Bringing my bishop into play. } 12. Nc2 {More
time wasting. } Qd5 {Bringing my queen out into the centre. Quite a bold
move because it's vulnerable there, but I felt like it was time to attack.
} 13. Qd3 {Fair enough, but your bishops still haven't joined the party.
} Rfd8 {The rook is now supporting the queen on the d file. } 14. Nb4 {Your
first big mistake. Before you move a piece check that it's going to be
safe on that square. } Nxb4 {Got your other knight and threatening your
queen. } 15. Qc3 {Your queen is still quite vulnerable there. } Ne4 {Threatening
your queen again. } 16. Qxb4 {A massive error. The knight was protected
by my bishop. } Bxb4+ {It's pretty much all over for you now. } 17. Ke2
{Ok} e5 {I'm hoping you'll take that pawn because I could win the game
next move by going to d1. } 18. b3 {Not sure why you did that. I guess
you could finally move the bishop to b2 next move. } exd4 {I want to come
down the middle with my queen.} 19. exd4 {I guess you don't have many options
there. } Qxd4 {I should be able to end the game pretty quickly from here.
Note that I'm also threatening your rook on a1. } 20. Kf3 {That was your
only choice I think. } Nxf2+ {I'm attacking the other rook on h1. } 21.
Kg3 {Not much choice again. } Nxh1+ {Got your rook. } 22. Kh2 {I decide
to let you have the knight and... } Qxa1 {take the other rook. } 23. Kxh1
{I'm not that bothered because now I've got your bishop. } Qxc1 {Your other
bishop is trapped now. You can't move it out of the way because you will
expose the king to check. } 24. Kh2 {You could have moved your king to
g1 to protect the bishop. } Qxf1 {Now it's dead and you're helpless. }
25. h4 {It's all over now I'm afraid ):} Qxg2#  0-1
