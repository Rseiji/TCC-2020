{So, a while back, my student, Erika asked me to annotate this game.  The
only reason I didn't have a chance was because I was educating people on
the importance of getting enough sleep.  That's especially because of the
fact that I led things get out of hands too often at work, and that's combined
with the fact that staying awake is needed to keep my job.  I'd be let
go if I fell asleep again, and this was also affecting my play in all ways.
 So, with that, I didn't have a chance to annotate a game, but with me
on vacation since I was, initially, going to go out of state combined with
not going (due to Corona Virus), today was the day where I'd annotate this
game.  This was interesting, and Erika missed an opportunity to win material.
 But, I was impressed with her play, and I think that she took note of
the sleep deprivation issue since I showed it to her in my club.  And,
I can tell by this game that she has improved, but her opponent kept making
mistakes which costed him this game.  Here's how it unfolded.} 1. e4 {Conventional.}
e5 {As is this move, but I'm interested to see what will come next.} 2.
Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {I was expecting to see the Italian Opening or Spanish Opening
(so in case you're wondering, that would be 3.Bc4 or 3.Bb5), Erika.  But,
this is also fine as it's the Three Knights Openings.} Nf6 {And, this is
the Four Knights Defense.} 4. Nxe5 {?? But, this is a blunder.  Can you
figure out why and how black should respond, Erika?} d6 {Your best move
would've been 4...Nxe5 winning a piece for a pawn, Erika.  As now, he'll
retreat and leave you a pawn down.} 5. Nc4 Be7 {But, I like this move,
as it gets Erika ready to castle.} 6. Be2 {The same thing is true for white.}
Bg4 {Trying to exchange Bishops.  I hate to tell you this Erika, but this
is a blunder.  I do see the point since his Bishop is more active then
his.  But, there's more to this, and it's something that I would've overlooked,
before my training games with Ken.  Having said that, what should white
do, and why would this be his best move?} 7. f3 {Believe it or not, his
best move would've been 7.Bxg4, and until those training sessions, it's
something that I would've overlooked.  And, part of it was, in fact, due
to sleep deprivation to how limited my concentration, and assessment is
what he coached me on.  That blends into it.  So, with that being said,
best was 7.Bxg6.  You might be thinking that this doesn't win material
since he has 7...Bxg4, but this would allow 8.Qxg4  The idea being is that
while is that your Bg4 is only defended once but attacked twice.} Bh5 8.
g4 Bg6 9. g5 {Going after pieces, but I'm not crazy about this move.  Instead,
I would've castled or tried to complete my development with 9.d3 or 9.b3.}
Nd7 10. f4 {Trying to block in the B.} h5 {Reasonable, as it prevents white
from winning a piece.} 11. h4 {Having said that, I would've played 11.gxh6
e.p., to take advantage of the en-pessant rule.  Be it note that knowing
the rule, I've sometimes, tried to trick Master Nathan into capturing en-pessant
but have failed.} Nd4 {Trying to exchange here, but this would have been
my goal.  Instead, I would've castled.} 12. f5 Bh7 13. f6 {Trying to force
Erika to undevelop the B, but it won't work.} gxf6 14. Rf1 {? And, I would've
exchanged pawns here.  Castling would've also come into consideration.
 But, this takes away his opportunity and, potentially, leaves his monarch
exposed.  It's also worth noting that this move will cost him a pawn. 
Best would've been 14.gxf6, as black is still down a pawn.  But, with this
move, even though it's equal, materialwise (which is for Erika to take
note of) black now has an advantage since white can't castle.} fxg5 15.
hxg5 Bxg5 16. Bxh5 Bh4+ {This is an example of why, as now, white must
lose the exchange (R for B).} 17. Rf2 Bxf2+ 18. Kxf2 Nf6 {I'm not surprised
to see Erika going after the B.  What white forgot is that it's protected.}
19. Qf3 {?? And, with that, this loses because of Erika plays next.  And,
when white captures, unlike previous games, Erika will take the B, leaving
her more then a Q up. } Nxf3 20. Kxf3 Nxh5 21. d4 {I'm not sure why white
played, but it doesn't matter since he doesn't have any good moves left.
 Having said that, I would resign here.  Having said that I'm going to
stop commenting on white's moves until later on.} f6 {Having said that,
I'd be looking at how much more damage I could cause with 21...Qf6+} 22.
d5 c6 {I would've castled here, but I like this move just as much.} 23.
a4 cxd5 {But, this is what I also would've done.} 24. exd5 Ng7 {I like
this move, but with the passed pawn, I would've castled to bring the R
behind the pawn.} 25. Nb6 {This just adds more insult to injury because
of what Erika plays next.} axb6 26. Ne4 {Threatening f6, but it's too little
too late.} Bg6 {Better was to liquidate with 26...Bxe4  Now that you're
far ahead, liquidating make things easier for you since white would be
left with less pieces.  } 27. b4 Rh3+ {I still would've played 27...Bxe4+
for the same reason.  But, I like this move even better, as I'd be hoping
that white would move his monarch away from the N which would leave black
another piece up.  But, there's a more important reason that this is better.
 As it's now mate in 2 which Erika finds.} 28. Kf4 Nh5+ 29. Kg4 Qd7#  0-1
