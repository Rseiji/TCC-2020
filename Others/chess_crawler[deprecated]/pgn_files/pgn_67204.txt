1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6
8. d5 Ne7 9. Ne1 Nd7 10. f3 f5 11. g4 {Benko Attack!} Nf6 {And here My
opponent took some thought what to play.  In postmortem he asked if played
the right move. } 12. Bg5 {And here I was out of book and loss for ideas...}
f4 13. Nd3 h5 14. h3 Nh7 15. Bh4 Bf6 16. Qe1 Ng5 {And here Black plays
for fork x-ray tactic.  } 17. Kg2 Kf7 {!?} 18. Rh1 {anticipating pawn exchanges
and rook on the h-files. } Ng8 19. Bf2 {getting away from any tactics...}
Nh6 20. h4 {? error on my play} Nxf3 21. Bxf3 hxg4 22. Bd1 g3 {In postmortem,
Black said he didn't seen anything in Pawn-f3 check and what to follow
up.} 23. Bxg3 fxg3 24. Qxg3 Rh8 25. c5 {Queen-side expansion as Black current
attack has stalled.} Rh7 {! And this was smart. Black is focused on Rg7
pinning Queening to King and winning. } 26. cxd6 cxd6 {It was here I thought
of Nxe5 check...} 27. Rc1 {! Rook on the open c-file will pay off!} Ng8
{Black triple attacks on Pawn-h4} 28. h5 Rg7 {gxh5; Bxh4+...Any King move;
and my position is holding. I was a bit shaky at this moment. } 29. h6
{forced..} Rh7 30. Nb5 {And White's queen-side expansion is in play...
25. c5; 27. Rc1; 30. Nb5 These ideas are very common in King's Indian}
Rxh6 31. Rc7+ {! White's attack commences.} Be7 {In postmortem Black said
this is better than any King move.} 32. Rxh6 Nxh6 {And here I assess that
Black's Knight-h6 is out of play and not doing anything. White has to attack
now or wind up losing his Rc7 with a6} 33. Nxe5+ {Knight sacrifice with
check! My opponent stated he didn't see this} dxe5 34. d6 {My plan. My
bishop can move with check, his Bishop is pinned. In postmortem he said
maybe Qxe5 is more forcing. I liked my pawn attacking more than this....plus
my knight is hanging and  the pawn push protects my Rook too!} Bd7 35.
Bb3+ Kf6 {??} 36. Qh4+ {!! White is winning.  Black's Queen-side Rook is
undeveloped and Bd7 has only moved once and like I stated earlier Knight
-h6 is out of play} Kg7 37. dxe7 {Best!} Qh8 {Black stated his only move?
Qe8 leads to Knight-d6 and queen-b8 leads to blocking in his own Rook.}
38. Rxd7 Re8 39. Nd6 b6 40. Nxe8+ Qxe8 41. Rd8 Qb5 42. e8=Q {I wonder if
e8=Knight+ leads to mate?} Qe2+ 43. Kg1 {The King takes a walk} Qe3+ 44.
Kf1 Qf3+ 45. Ke1 Qe3+ 46. Kd1 Qf3+ 47. Kc2 Qe2+ 48. Rd2 {Black Resigns..}
