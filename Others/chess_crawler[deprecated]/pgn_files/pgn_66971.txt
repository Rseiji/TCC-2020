1. e4 {This was one of my first games on GameKnot and my first game of
chess in quite some time. The loose sort of plan I opened with e4 here
intending to play through the Giuoco Piano opening.  I know this opening
inside out. It's the first one I ever learned and was among the reasons
I became my high school's champion (undefeated in the tournament too).}
e5 {Pretty standard response from black.} 2. Nf3 {2. Nf3  Places pressure
on black's center pawn.} f6 {3.... f6?  My father would be ripping his
hair out if he saw me play this. The King's Bishop Pawn is a massive weakness
in either side and in the early game is strongest right where it is. This
just invites a withering King side attack.} 3. Nxe5 {3. Nxe5  A bit of
promising bait thrown in here. I always used to struggle with this when
I was first learning the game. I never quite understood why, in this situation,
losing a lowly pawn for the tricky knight was actually a bad deal for me.
  Mind you. The pawn attacking the knight in these situations would have
been my Queen's Pawn. I still remember the look my father would give me
to this day if I so much as brushed the King's Bishop Pawn early on.  I
was expecting 3... Qe7} fxe5 {3.... fxe5?  Black's second mistake in as
many moves. That king side looks awfully open to me at this point and I
fully intend on ripping black open from here on in.  I am a bit ruthless
in my chess. If I see something, I am going for it!} 4. Qh5+ {4. Qh5+ 
Here I aim to open the game up further. 4... g6 would have been a minor
inconvenience but not one that would overly concern me at this point.}
Ke7 {4.... Ke7?  Now the black king is mostly exposed.... time to turn
that into completely exposed with....} 5. Qxe5+ {5. Qxe5+  My Queen now
issuing a charge command to her loyal troops!} Kf7 {He didn't have much
choice here.} 6. Bc4+ {6. Bc4+  Continuing my development AND increasing
the pressure on the black king. My aim here is to develop quickly. Take
control of the board and pour in through the King side.} d5 {With all due
respect to my opponent here.  I wonder at this point if my opponent suffers
from an anxiety a lot of new players experience and expect everyone else
to experience the same.  The old 'If I take that piece, he'll just take
me!' issue.} 7. Bxd5+ {7. Bxd5+  Poor black is really on the back foot
now.} Be6 {7. ....Be6???  Here black blundered giving me a mate next move.
Better would have been 7.... Kg6  Even so at this better position I would
likely resign if I were black. As the game continues, white would continue
developing causing many issues with any attempt by the black king to retreat
to safety. Black would lose more tempo to white which would likely end
the game in white's favour.} 8. Qxe6# {8. Qxe6#  Checkmate. This was quite
a savage game on my part it must be said, but I do not hold back. If I
see it... I go for it!}  1-0
