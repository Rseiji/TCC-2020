{As noted in the previous consultation game, the opposing captain, goldentweety,
wanted to do a consultation match between my and theirs.  For those that
are wondering, I'm copying and pasting the game chat.  But, I don't vote
when playing.  Instead, I play the moves that the majority votes on.  The
whole idea is so that they would learn something.  But, it works perfectly
for this team, especially since I'll later post in the Chess Problems Lovers
Club for ION's analysis.  I started with, so this would be for the second
one since this is a match. In the previous thread, we're white. But, in
the second, we're going to be black. There is someone interested, and as
soon as, I get another participant, I will challenge him to the second
game.} 1. c4 {bluenoser: d6 or Nf6 which would be my usual response to
c4.  roneshet: d6 can you explain in a sentence the reason for d6?  a_random_guy:
1...Nf6 That knight belongs on f6.  The d pawn can still be moved up 1
or 2 squares later, depending on white's move.  roneshet: Nf6 Sorry for
asking. Why is it important to move to knight now?  ptitroque: 1. Nf6 is
ok for me.} Nf6 2. g3 {bluenoser: d6 Possible Pirc defence?  a_random_guy:
2...c6 Again, there are multiple viable moves here, it is mostly a matter
of preference.  I pick 2...c6, to prepare to push d5 at once.  roneshet:
c6 I agree. I think his next move will be Bg2 - so c6 will also defend
our castle...} c6 3. Nf3 {roneshet: d5 I'm not sure. But i think we need
to open the middle a little bit.  bluenoser: g6 g6 with thoughts of Bg7
developing and getting ready for our king side castle, if they play d4
we could play d3 instead of Bg7. I think d5 could really open things up
also, with lots of possibilities. I just like to play a bit more defence.
 a_random_guy: 3...d5 After all, we played 2...c6 to prepare 3...d5.  ptitroque:
3.d5 is good. We shouldn't let whate taking the control of the center (not
without fighting for it, at least)} d5 4. b3 {a_random_guy: 4...Bg4 Simple
developpement move.  Alternatives are 4...e6, 4...g6, 4...Bf5 and 4...dxc4.
 bluenoser: 4...Bg4 Looks good to me  ptitroque: 4... g6 To fiancheto our
DSB, as they have opened the long black diagonal. Our LSB could also be
nicely placed in e6 - we can see later were to settle it.  roneshet: Bf5
I say we should take out our bishop, so we can open the way to take out
the knight afterwards to d7. then we can move safely e5.} Bg4 5. Bg2 {bluenoser:
e6?? I was thinking e6 to open our diagonal for our Bishop. We could also
play g6 with intent of Bg7 and castling.  a_random_guy: 5...e6 is fine
Overprotecting d5 is a good idea, it lets our DSB out and our LSB is already
out, so it won't be locked in.  An alternative here would be 5...Nbd7.
It likely transposes into the same lines.  roneshet:  Nbd7 I thinks we
need to protect e5 - the middle. Than we can move to e5 next move. The
way i see it, d5 is already overprotected...  ptitroque: 5. e6 Freeing
our DSB, so that we'll be able to castle whithin 2 moves and have control
over the a3 f8 diagonal. Nbd7 ik ok as well. } e6 6. O-O {a_random_guy:
6...Nbd7 It's clear that our b knight belongs to d7 for now, to support
f6, e5 and c5, so we may as well play it now. We'll have to wait for White's
reply to figure out what is the optimal square for our black squared bishop.
 roneshet: Nbd7 I agree. I think we should also prepare for right side
castling. we need the h8 rock there.  ptitroque: 6... Nbd7 For the sames
reasons than a random guy. We have to get control on c5 and e5. We have
no other proper place for the knight. We have several squares for the DSB
(depending on what they will play and the strategy, we'll decide.  bluenoser:
6.....Nbd7 Appears to be our best move.  } Nbd7 7. Bb2 {ptitroque: 7. Bd6
We can play a further e5 to take control of the center.  a_random_guy:
7...Bd6 Seems fine to me.  An acceptable alternative would be 7...Be7,
to overprotect our f6 knight.  roneshet: How about Bc5? Why not advance
a little and position the bishop on a further diagonal?  a_random_guy:
About 7...Bc5. That move isn't actually horrible, it's just that white
can push d4 at once and force us to move our bishop again, while they reinforce
their center. That d4 push would partially block their dark-squared bishop
though, so there's that. Also, I don't really see the bishop being usefull
on the a7-g1 diagonal for the moment, since they can easily close that
diagonal. 7.Bd6 could help prepare an e5 pawn push by black, eventually
after castling.  bluenoser: Bd6 Of the two moves suggested I like Bd6.
Bc5 in my opinion just helps them push d4 and chase our bishop around.
I guess so far we are in agreement to move that Bishop. I do believe Bd6
to be more solid for us.} Bd6 8. d3 {bluenoser: Castle? Would now be a
good time  a_random_guy: 8...0-0 Yeah, it would be a good time to castle!
 ptitroque: 8.O-O We've got to castle short so let's do it now} O-O 9.
Nbd2 {ptitroque: interresting position 9... e5 Not sure about it, it's
getting complicated.  9th move ...maybe it's worth a discussion, we shouldn't
decide to quickly. (discussions are interresting in this kind of games,
because it's how to learn...)  bluenoser: 9....e5 I too was looking at
this move...Like you I think it is worth some discussion could be a key
move in the game. I was also looking at Qc7, then e5...but that might be
too slow as they may push d4.  ptitroque: Qc7? seems ok but if they play
a further Rc1, we might be in trouble.  roneshet: Qe7 - Why trouble? Can
you explain a little bit, why are we going to be in trouble if the do Rc1?
I think e5 is a very good move. I thought of h6 also. opening up for the
king.  ptitroque: @roneshet If 1. ... Qc7 2. Rc1 Let's suppose 2... b6
(or anything else) 3. cxd5 exd5 4. Nd4 * But you suggested Qe7 which is
another matter. I'll have a look.  ptitroque: @ roneshed (about Qe7) 9...
Qe7 seems safe for me, but we'll be heading to a close game and be less
active. It's more chances to end with a draw.  Now, it's a question of
general strategy.  a_random_guy: 9...Re8 To free f8 for our knight if needed,
and to prepare the e5 pawn push.  ptitroque: 9...Re8 I checked again to
see if 9...e5 was possible and it's indeed dangerous to play it right now.
With Re8, it'll be safer. } Re8 10. h3 {ptitroque: 10... Bf5 We have only
2 other options : 10... Bh5 but I do not like this line because of 11.e4
10... Bxf3 but we'll lose the bishop pair and get nothing in exchange.
 roneshet: Bf5 of Bxf3 I think Bf5 is better. Bxf3 will let him take out
this locked bishop...let him stay there...  bluenoser: 10...Bf5 I like
this move Bf5, let them chase it if they want.  a_random_guy: 10...Bh5
Seems fine to me, we can always push e5 if they do push e4.  ptitroque:
10.... Bh5 I've had a closer look and it seems it works.  bluenoser: Try
Again here What makes Bh5 better than better than Bf5? I am not disagreeing
just wondering why we want to stay on that diagonal.  ptitroque: @bluenoser
a random guy probably has a better analyse than I do. The only little advantage
I can find in Bh5 is that it is on the diagonal of their queen. Obviously
they will notice it but it may limitate their moving possibilities at some
points.  a_random_guy: @ptiroque The problem I see with 10...Bf5 is that
they can basically play 11.Nh4 to trade off our bishop for their knight.
If they want to push g5 to push our bishop to g3 before forcing a trade
with 12.Nh4, they'd have weakened their kingside more in that variation
then if we had played 10...Bf5.  ptitroque: @a random guy Thanks, I didn't
thought about Nh4  bluenoser: thanks for explaining I can see it now! 
 } Bh5 11. Qc2 {roneshet: e5 Get a better stand at the middle. next d4.
 ptitroque: I hesitate e5 was indeed my first idea but we'll probably obtain
a close game, for we'll have to push our d pawn if they play e4 and I do
not like that kind of games.  Qc7 is another possibility, connecting our
rooks  bluenoser: 11....e5 e5 looks good to me, may give us a close game,
but I believe we will have more space. } e5 12. a3 {ptitroque: Hmmm hmm
It seems that they plan to attack our queenside...  I consider 12... Qc7
: completing our developpement by joining our rooks and protecting our
DSB in cas if they trade the central pawns. 12... e4 seems also playable,
more aggressive. They'll have to respond energically if they want to avoid
13... e3. which would put them in troubles.  a_random_guy: Another option
12...a4, to slow down white's advance on the queenside.  ptitroque: @ a
random guy 12... a4 ? Do you mean 12... a6 or 12... a5  What about if white
answer 13. e4 ?  I suppose that both could be played  a_random_guy: Oops
I meant 12...a5, yeah.  roneshet: d4? Taking more controll over the center
of the board } a5 13. e4 {ptitroque: I propose 13... dxe4 to prevent their
knight to come on g5  a_random_guy: 13...d4 I don't really see Ng5 as a
threat, as it doesn't attack anything and we can just push it back with
h6.  That being said, I'd suggest locking the center with 13...d4 instead
to make both of their bishops locked in.  bluenoser: 13...d4 13...I like
d4, I don't see the Ng5 as a big threat. Also gives us space advantage
and their two bishops don't look very troublesome right now or in the near
future.  roneshet: dxe4 explain please explain a little more about the
reasoning. why would it prevent their knight from coming to g5? h6 would
do it?} d4 14. Rab1 {roneshet: —Å5 a better stand in the middle.  a_random_guy:
14...Qe7 c5 is probably fine, but I also like 14...Qe7, attacking the a
pawn.  bluenoser: Qe7 Qe7 forces them protect their a pawn either by pushing
it or moving the rook they've already moved. My bet would be they will
push the a pawn.  ptitroque: Qe7 ...might lead to a less close game, personnaly,
I prefer it.} Qe7 15. Ra1 {ptitroque: 15... b5 The situation is blocked
on the center. We could try to push on the right wing  bluenoser: 16...b5
I don't see a better move than b5.} b5 16. Nh4 {roneshet: Qe6 If they will
not notice the trap, They will respond with Nf3. And than we can do Bxf3,
the will respond with Bxf3 and we can do Qh3...  a_random_guy: Hmmm Both
17.Nf5 and 17.f4 could be quite annoying for us. I'd suggest 16...Bg6 here.
 ptitroque: 16... Bg6 Yes, we must have some control on f5 } Bg6 17. Nf5
{a_random_guy: 17...Bxf5 Probably followed by 18.exf5 Rac8.  roneshet:
Bxf5 Well, this was our plan all along...  bluenoser: 17....Bxf5 I don't
see anything better! } Bxf5 18. exf5 {ptitroque: 18... Rac8 protecting
the pawn - indirect menace on their Q  bluenoser: 18...Rac8 Rac8 also appears
to be forced to me.} Rac8 19. Rfe1 {ptitroque: 20... Be5 We are cramped.
 The immediate threat is 20. Bxd4, for our e5 pawn is pinned. I do not
see any counterthreat for us. I believe that we should play 20... Be5 
But maybe I've overlooked something.  bluenoser: Be5? I don't believe our
Bishop will go to e5 if my diagram is right. It could possibly go to c5
 a_random_guy: 19...Qf8 Sure, 19...Qf8 looks ugly, but it does unpin our
e pawn and it provides additionnal support to our c8 rook, if they decide
to pile on the c file.} Qf8 20. g4 {roneshet: h5 To open up this defense
a little bit. if they answer with g5, we can do Nfh7  a_random_guy: 20...h6
I don't like 20...h5 due to 20...h5 21.g5 Nh7 22.h4, locking us in even
more. I think we need to stop g5 from happening, since white really wants
to bring their knight onto e4. By playing h6, we stop that plan for now
and still open up h7 for the knight.  ptitroque: 20...h6 seems fine, indeed
 bluenoser: 20....h6 h6 looks good to me...it is the other game that is
a tricky one at the moment. } h6 21. Re2 {roneshet: N7c5 Threatening b3
and d3. In addition we put it in a very central position.  bluenoser: 21.
b4? I was looking at b4 which would give us more space and everything is
protected.  ptitroque:  I do not like b4 2 possibilities ;  21... b4 22.
axb4 axb4 23. Ra6 and we are in trouble.  21... b4 22. axb4 Bxb4 and we
have an isolated pawn on the a file, which will be hard to defend.  bluenoser:
21,b4 On 22. axb4 Bx4 was my intent, I don't see why it will be hard to
defend as we have a pin on rook as the knight is on the same diagonal.
You of course have the higher rating so I could be missing things moves
down the road.} Nc5 {I generally don't post when, but I put down that this
was Ron's suggestion.  The logic behind this is one person voted for 21...b4,
and the other disagrees.  But, Ron voted for this move independently of
everyonelse based on what he thought was best.  And, I can relate to that,
for the wrong reason, as well.  As this is how I thought during, I hate
to say it, but the kibitzing moment in GM Judit Polgar's puzzle with the
terrible headache.  That was, based on, what I thought the best move would
be, independently of everyonelse.  Plus we starting to run into danger
of losing the game on time here, as we had about 2 days left.  And, that
was, during a day off from work..} 22. b4 {bluenoser: 22....axb4 22...axb4...if
23. ax b4....Nh5.  roneshet: Axb4 We knew they'd do that move...  ptitroque:
22... axb4 We are in trouble. I'm not sure it holds.  bluenoser: We could
be in trouble I think you care correct Ptitgorque. We should have seen
this sereral moves back, or I should say our higher rated players should
have seen it coming....I for one didn't.} axb4 23. axb4 {ptitroque: 23...
Nd7 We need to defend our e5 pawn - vital for our defense.  If they play
Ra e1 and a further Nf3, we need at least 3 pieces to defend e5 and 2 of
them have to be knights or bishops (since we have no pawn available to
defend it).  roneshet: Na4 Well Nd7 is also a good move, adding protection
to the e5 pawn, and defending the other Knight. But i think the danger
from the rock on the A column is more imidiate...  bluenoser: 23...Na5
I believe this was our original plan.  a_random_guy: 23...Na4 This blocks
the a file, preventing their rook from landing on a6 and pressuring our
c6 pawn. In a pinch, we could trade our a4 night for their b2 bishop, to
reduce pressure on our central pawns. I don't think trading the rook for
our knight is worth it for white for now, if they want to play Rxa4, though
I could be wrong.  (I fixed some typos from my previous post) } Na4 24.
c5 {roneshet: Bb1 We can't put our B on c2 or e2, because it will lead
to losing one of our pawns... Bb1, as far as I can tell, is the only viable
move.  ptitroque: Bb1 Yes, I see no other solution} Bb8 25. Rae1 {ptitroque:
I suggest NxB2 Our knight is poorly placed and stuck. Their DSB is on a
fine diagonal (it could take our d4 pawn it e5 dies, which is probable
soon, for they will play Kf3 and we cannot prevent it). I admit that it
doesn't solve the problem of our e5 pawn.  Maybe someone has something
better to propose...  roneshet: Nxb2 or Nd5 I agree, but we shpuld consider,
after or before, this line of defence on the e4 pawn. Nd5 Bxd5 cxd5 Nf3
f6 ... ptitroque: Nd5 Is an option that I din't consider seriously but
it's worth to analyse it.  thewrongreason: So, ptitroque mentioned about
what we ought to consider which was with Ron. I can wait a little, but
by tomorrow evening, at the very latest, I'd have to make the move. As
we're down to a little more then 2 days left to make the move.  bluenoser:
Nd5 Nd5 looks good to me. they can't do much with their B on b2 I think
we are helping oursevles more by playing the Nd5. } Nd5 26. Bxd5 {ptitroque:
26... cxd5 what else ?  roneshet: only move Cxd5 is the only move} cxd5
27. Ba1 {ptitroque: 27... Qe7 They'll probably attack our unpritected d5
pawn, so that our queen can come and defend it on d7.  If they chose to
move their knight on b3, we can menace their king side by Qh4. Our queen
has to be mobile.  roneshet: agreed Qe7, looks like a good option. I like
the Qh4 option...  a_random_guy: 27...f7 27...Qe7 allows them to play 28.Bxd4,
as our e5 pawn would be pinned. 27...f7 would help to protect our e5 pawn,
and prepare Qf7 (protecting our d5 pawn while keeping an eye on e8) and
Kf8. geting out of the g8-a2 diagonal, and protecting e8 once more.  ptitroque:
27 th move a random guy is of course right. Qe7 doesn't work.  27. f7 is
ok. They have no more LSB to menace our king on the a2-g7 diagonal.} f6
28. Nf3 {roneshet: Qf7 I say, Qf7 following by h5, will open their king
side...  How are you all doing with the corona madness?  ptitroque: 28...Qf7
seems ok  protecting our d5 pawn and giving mobility to our queen  bluenoser:
Qf7 Qf7 looks good to me too.} Qf7 29. Nh4 {ptitroque: 29... Qc7 ?! Gives
us a strong menace : they cannot prevent us to play e4 and we have a mating
menace. If they play f3, we can play Qg3+ and their knight gets it.  Please
gentlement check carefully, for it's edge to edge situation  bluenoser:
Qc7? I was thinking Qc7 with thoughts of pushing our e5p to e4. with the
threath of Qh2. Just taking a quick look at this so far.  ptitroque: 29...
Qc7 !? The more I think about it, the better it seems. We might get an
overwhelming attack  roneshet: problems... if they move their knight to
g6 after we do Qc7, we cam be in a great deal of trouble. 29. ... Qc7 30.
Ng6 e4  Than what will we do? say they do f3... 31. f3 Qg3+ 32. Kf1   We
should not open our e column... It's dangerous!!!  ptitroque: @ roneshed
29... Qc7 30. Ng6 e4 31. f3 Qg3 32. Rd2 (forced) Qe1 chessmate } Qc7 30.
f4 {bluenoser: f4 was unexpected. We were all thinking f3 for some reason.....Going
to have to look this one over really good now.  roneshet: e4 I still think
e4 is a good move.  bluenoser: e4? I've been wondering if that is still
the best follow up move?  a_random_guy: I don't like 30...e4. 30...Qc6
maybe? They can play 31.Ng6, covering their f4 pawn and leaving our d4
pawn defenseless.  I think this position is bad for us, and is actually
quite complicated; They might want to pile on everything they have onto
e5.  That being said, I'm unsure what the best move would be: Here are
all the moves I could see being played:  Kf7, Qc6, Nb6, Nc3  Personally,
I prefer 30...Qc6: We still threaten to take on f4, and it unpins our e5
pawn as e8 now has enough protection for now. It also protects our d5 pawn
as well, as it could get targeted by their queen in some lines.  bluenoser:
Qc6 Qc6 does look like a solid move for sure.  roneshet: Qc6 I really learned
from your explanation, thanks. Qc6, leads to minimum losses at the moment...
 ptitroque: 30... Qc6 seems good, indeed } Qc6 31. Ng6 {a_random_guy: 31...Nc3
I think we can't quite play 31...exf4 sue to 32.Bxd4, locking our knight
to a4 forever. By playing Nc3, we more or less force them to exchange their
bishop for our useless knight.  Sample line:  1. ... Nc3 2. Bxc3 dxc3 3.
fxe5 Bxe5 4. Nxe5 Rxe5 5. Rxe5 fxe5 6. Rxe5 Re8 7. Rxe8+ Qxe8 8. Qxc3 Qe3+
* Likely a draw?  roneshet: sounds good Nc3 Also will open the way for
d5 to move to d4, thus opening the way for the queen.  bluenoser: Nc3 looks
good Nc3 looks good to me, maybe our only good move. The sequence after
could change along the way. I know you are looking at what you consider
best moves on each side. They may do something different which might even
give us winning chances.} Nc3 32. Bxc3 {bluenoser: 32.....dXc3 dxc3 is
our only move as predicted by a_random_guy.  a_random_guy: 32...dxc3 Not
much else to say here. The question is whether they'll play 33.Qxc3 or
33.fxe5 (probably the latter).} dxc3 33. Qxc3 {ptitroque: 33... d4 if 34.Qb3
(probable), then 34... Kh7  bluenoser: 33...d4 d4 looks good to me. I know
I can't look as deep into the game as ptitroque can.  a_random_guy:  I
dislike 33...d4. I'd suggest 33...e4 instead They can play 34.Qb3+, and
it would give them the time to take on e5 safely, leaving us 2 pawns down
like in this line:  1. ... d4 2. Qb3+ Kh7 3. fxe5 fxe5 4. Nxe5 Bxe5 5.
Rxe5 Rxe5 6. Rxe5 *  I also just realized we can't play play 33.exf4 either,
due to Ne7+. I think we've already lost this game, but 33...e4 seems like
our best bet to keep us into the game, not opening the e file yet and stopping
a series of disavantageous trades on e5.  roneshet: Qc7 That being said,
and i think well said. we can add a little bit more defense on the e5 square,
while also preventing the option of Ne7+, which will be devastating.  bluenoser:
33....e4 Yes of course e4 not d4....That is the move I was looking at too.
but did say d4 which was not correct.} e4 {roneshet: Qc7 no one has responded..
Though we already made the move, I'd like to hear you opinion on QC7. If
it's possible. Thanks!  ptitroque: @roneshed about Qc7 I believe it would
have been a bad move for 2 reasons  1. Offensive reason We cannot take
the f4 pawn which is protected by the g knight and we have no chance to
capture or force the g knight to move.  2. Defensive reason It would enable
white to play dxe4 without trouble : 33. dxe4 dxe4 34. Rxe4 Rxe4 35. Rxe4
and white has control on the open file with plenty of attacking possibilities.}
34. Qd4 {a_random_guy: 34...Kf7 I don't think we can prevent the loss of
another pawn; The best we can do is activate our pieces, avoid trading
our pieces and trade some pawns.} Kf7 35. dxe4 {roneshet: qa6? go around
to threaten h3, g3  a_random_guy: Resign I can't think of a good move here,
I'm pretty sure we've already lost at this point. Sorry!  bluenoser: Resign
I believe I agree here. I can' see them making any major mistakes. Perhaps
it will be another learning experience for everyone.  thewrongreason: We
have resigned here. I'll be annotating this game later this week.  For
those that are wondering, my resignation was GG.}  1-0
