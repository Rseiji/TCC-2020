1. d4 {This was a very interesting game. I held my highly rated opponent
for most of the game, but missed the best move after all the complications
seemed to have passed and I lost quickly after that.} Nf6 {My usual reply.}
2. c4 {The most common move.} g6 {Heading towards Gr端nfeld Defence positions.}
3. g3 {I was half expecting him to play this at some point, as I had seen
he plays the Catalan against the Queen's Gambit Declined.} Bg7 {So I just
continue.} 4. Bg2 {He is now threatening e2-e4. I could just allow it and
go into King's Indian Defence structures, but I decide to stay true to
The Gr端nfeld Defence.} d5 {Systems in which White delays the development
of his queen's knight to c3 are known as the Neo-Gr端nfeld Defence, such
as this.} 5. cxd5 {He takes, as in the main line Systems in the Gr端nfeld
Defence } Nxd5 {I take back. I was expecting 6. e4 now.} 6. Nf3 {This is
actually more common.} c5 {I strike at his centre.} 7. e4 {And now he does
attack my knight.} Nb4 {Rather than meekly retreat I decide to advance.
We are already out of the books - retreats to b6 or c7 have been played
before.} 8. d5 {Fritz prefers a3.} f5 {Striking at the white centre before
he can consolidate. Fritz likes this move.} 9. a3 {He now hits my knight}
fxe4 {Once again, instead of retreating, I counter-attack.} 10. axb4 {He
takes.} exf3 {I take.} 11. Qxf3 {He takes back with his queen, preventing
immediate castling.} cxb4 {I take the pawn.} 12. O-O {He castles. In return
for the pawn he has better development and better pawn structure. Chances
are roughly level.} Nd7 {With the options of going to f6 or e5.} 13. Re1
{The logical way of developing his rook. The pin on the e file could be
useful.} Ne5 {I attack his queen.} 14. Qb3 {He threatens my pawn and d5-d6
could be a powerful discovery at some stage. } a5 {I protect the pawn on
b4. Fritz prefers Bf5 with equality.} 15. Bf4 {He attacks my knight.} Nf7
{The knight is heading for the fine blockading square on d6.} 16. Nd2 {He
develops his knight.} O-O {I finally castle.} 17. Ne4 {His knight moves
up the board.} Nd6 {I blockade his isolated d pawn with my knight - the
best blockading piece.} 18. Rac1 {The logical square to put his a rook,
along the open file.} Bf5 {at last this bishop comes out.} 19. Nc5 {The
knight hops in.} Rc8 {I did see some of the following complications. I
did see he could exchange on d6 and then win the b pawn, but I thought
his knight was then trapped on b7.} 20. Bxd6 {He takes.} exd6 {I take back.}
21. Ne6 {Indeed his knight is trapped if he takes on b7, but he comes in
here, forking queen and rook.} Bxe6 {So I take.} 22. dxe6 {He takes back.}
Qe7 {and I block the advance of his e pawn.} 23. Bxb7 {and he gets his
pawn back. Now of course, if I take the bishop he has e7+ winning rook
for pawn.} Rxc1 {I take his rook.} 24. Rxc1 {He takes back.} Bxb2 {and
I follow suit!} 25. Rc7 {But he has this!} Qxc7 {More or less forced!}
26. e7+ {Now the black king is forced onto a black square where the Bb2
can be taken with check.} Kg7 {as good as anywhere!} 27. Qxb2+ {Takes with
check. If now Rf6? 28. pe8=N+! Now the best defence for black is Qc3 and
I am still in the game. Now it is hopeless.} Kf7 {Funny how such a simple,
obvious move can be such a mistake.} 28. Bd5+ {Gaining a tempo.} Kxe7 {So
I take the pawn.} 29. Qg7+ {A nasty check. I could have just retreated
the king to d8.} Rf7 {But I played this. I was looking at now 30. Bxf7
threatening a discovery with his bishop and if 30...Kd8 then 31. Qf8 mates.
However 30...Kd8 is not forced and he hasn't really got any wonderful discovered
checks.} 30. Qxf7+ {so this is just as good.} Kd8 {Forced!} 31. Qg8+ {another
check, two more pawns are going.} Kd7 {Nothing better} 32. Qxh7+ {First
pawn goes.} Kc8 {King drops back.} 33. Qxg6 {Second pawn drops. I will
just add the final moves without further comment.} Qc5 34. Qe8+ Kc7 35.
Qe7+ Kc8 36. Qb7+ Kd8 37. h4 a4 38. Be6 Qc7 39. Qxc7+ Kxc7 40. h5 {and
black finally resigns. Thank you for reading. Please leave a comment or
two and rate this annotation on the star system. Until next time dear reader!}
