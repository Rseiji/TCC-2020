{ALL COMMENTS WELCOME - Especially how I screwed up in my thinking during
the moves.  All my comments are how I was thinking during the game, not
post game analysis  OK, facing chess master, my level probably 1550 to
1600 as I seem to win around 1/3 of games with players ranked that on GK
 } 1. d4 {Going for Queens Gambit, the only opening I have ever looked
at in a book for 30 minutes once ten years ago.} b5 {Don't recall black
playing b5 on move 1 in any of thousands of games here.  My only used opening
is now ended on turn 2, lol  I can't recall black going d5 on turn 1 in
any game I have ever played} 2. Nf3 {Develop pieces, control center} Bb7
3. Bg5 {Plan, develop bishop before e3.  Goal:  Set up king side attack
with all pieces.} h6 {Reasonably forces retreat} 4. Bh4 g5 {Strange.  Opens
king side pon structure before develops pieces or controls center.  Probably
has already realized I am ChessNoob.} 5. Bg3 {Control center} Bg7 {Black
has two strong diagonal controls of center but no central pon control}
6. c3 {Three defense d4} g4 {Black has two attacks on f3, I do not have
enough piece development to move to 5th rank, must maintain control of
center ('cause someone said that's important)} 7. Nfd2 {Also preparing
for e3 or e4} d5 {Black moves to center but blocks his diagonal, allowing
me to develop my white square bishop} 8. e3 {pon structure} c6 9. h3 {Attack
undefended pon, my plan is kingside attack/exchange so the passed pon helps
me out} h5 {Is this a mistake here by black?  There must be a number of
development moves he could have done with his knights} 10. Be2 {Triple
attack on g4 to control position after exchange} Nf6 {His defense of g4
too late and miraculously I realize it} 11. hxg4 {I got this} hxg4 {Not
good enough} 12. Rxh8+ {Exchange rooks} Bxh8 13. Bxg4 {Up one pon and I
have strong positional control on two diagonals. Is knight takes bishop
blacks best move here?} Nxg4 14. Qxg4 {Hard to see any way I do not have
positional control here. His left side pons face a solid defense queenside,
I have control of the center, and he has no king side defense.} Bc8 {Attack
queen} 15. Qg8+ {Force his king to block his bishop development} Kd7 {Black
pays for undeveloped pon structure} 16. Qxf7 {2nd pon gained, black squares
near king controlled, Q threatens check, my potential castling queen side
free's my rook along unguarded king side } Bf6 {No idea why he does this
but intuitively I know somehow we will be exchanging queens if I don't
move } 17. Qh5 {Setting up for future h file battery after Kn to f3, Kn
to d2, and castling.} c5 {blunder (!) results in me winning d5 and c5,
Black resigns  First win for me from player ranked over 2000, so pretty
sweet. }  1-0
