{So, we picked up from where we left off.  I was wondering who I'd be up
against and thought that it would be Master Nathan since Jack said that
I'd have to play against him, next time.  But, he was in the middle of
a game, so I was against Carl and because I was white last time, I had
to be black this time.  It was an interesting game, but I went wrong by
thinking that Carl missed the overall picture and didn't see the entire
board.  As I thought that I had a mate but overlooked one move that sealed
my fate.} 1. e4 {Carl changes openings, but I'm glad he played this, as
I was answer with the Sicilian.} c5 2. c4 {He opts for the closed variation.}
d6 {But, I continue with my usual.} 3. Qa4+ {But, I was surprised to see
Carl throw in the check this early.} Bd7 {So, I go right on the offense
to punish Carl for bringing out his Q too early before developing.} 4.
Qb3 {And, not surprisingly, he goes after my b7 pawn and Ra8.} Bc6 {I considered
giving that pawn up with 4...Nc6 as after 5.Qxb7, I could go after his
Q again with 5...Rb8  I studied a similar variation with GM Susan Polgar,
but in that case, she was reviewing how you'd trap one of white's R or
Q.  But, that wasn't applicable here, and I also played this to attack
his e4 pawn.} 5. Nc3 {Meanwhile, Carl starts developing.} Nf6 {And, I continue,
as well.} 6. d3 {Opening up a line for his Bc1.  But, it takes him longer
to develop it then anticipated.} g6 {In the meantime, I decide to fianchetto
since I like a nice long diagonal for my B.  } 7. g3 {As does Carl.  Of
course, we don't copy each other moves, which is ill advised, but we're
thinking along the same lines which is why I complete my fianchetto on
my next move.} Bg7 8. Bg2 {As does Carl.} Nbd7 {Completing my development,
and what I kept in mind is that I can't play 8...Nc6 for the obvious reason,
and I wasn't going to leave my N on the rim with 8...Na6.  Carl also has
the same idea since he'll play it, on his next move.  } 9. Nge2 Ne5 {What
I mentioned about what I couldn't do with the N and what I wasn't going
to do is why I played this.  My attitude was that if I can't play 8...Nc6,
then I'd play 8...Nbd7 with the idea of getting my N to a stronger outpost.
 In fact, this centralizes my N since it's in the center.  So, I was confident
here as I felt that I had a space advantage with more space in the center.
 Not only that, but this attacks d3 which I kept in mind.} 10. Qc2 {Not
surprisingly, Carl protects.} O-O {Which is when I castle, as does Carl,
on his next move.  The thing to remember is that I like to castle early,
but I delayed it a couple of moves to get my N right in the center.} 11.
O-O Qd7 {Planning to attack his Q.} 12. Nd5 {I was wondering what to do
and almost refused to exchange here.  But, I felt that his Nd5 was more
active and mobile then my Nf6 since the N is right in front of the B and
restricted in movement.  In fact, besides undeveloping, the squares I can
place my N are on g4 or h5, where white would take advantage of the fact
that it's on the rim and would attack with h3.  So, under that ground I
felt that exchanging was the way to go here because I'm a little worried
about what he'll try to do with his Nd5.} Nxd5 13. exd5 Ba4 {And, that's
when I go after his Q.  Carl's next move was to be expected.} 14. b3 Qf5
{?? Keeping in mind that d3 is pinned.  But, this move shouldn't have even
come into consideration.  My thinking was that if 15.bxa4 I could get a
pawn with 15...Nxd3 which also threatens a discovered attack on his Q.
 But, since it would be with my Q, he could just exchange be a piece for
pawn up with a strong advantage for white.} 15. Rd1 {Having Tunnel Vision
and playing too fast, Carl was worried about the pawn and played this.
 Best would've been, as noted a move back, 15.bxa4!.  By playing this,
I can and will retreat.} Bd7 16. Bb2 {Completing his development.  But,
I prepare to exchange by throwing in a check.  I normally wouldn't, but
the idea behind playing my next is that after we exchange, his Ne2 will
be half pinned.} Nf3+ 17. Bxf3 Qxf3 18. Bxg7 {I was wondering what to do
here.  I thought about recapturing which I should've done.} Bh3 {?? But,
this is where I thought that Carl didn't see everything that was happening
the board, the overall picture.  So, I decided to swarm in with my B which
is very similar to how bhidragon did things in our last game.   I made
a similar mistake against Perry where I thought it was mate but missed
one move that costed me the Q.  As now, Carl almost overlooked his next
move, and when he plays it, I'll be a piece down without compensation.}
19. Nf4 Kxg7 {Having said that, I take his B.} 20. Nxh3 {I was not surprised
to see him take my B.} Qg4 {But, I still try swarm in by going after his
N.} 21. Nf4 e5 {And, I continue with the attack and prepare for his en-pessant
capture.} 22. dxe6 e.p. fxe6 23. Re1 {Going after my pawn.} e5 {Which I
defend, but best was 23...Rxf4 winning back a piece.  Of course, I overlooked
that his g3 pawn was still pinned.  But, this is the losing blunder, and
if this were online chess, I would've kept in mind that the pawn was pinned.
 Had I played that, I'd only be down a pawn, but I'd probably be lost anyway
since Carl had a lot more time then me.  So, I probably would've lost on
time, but by playing this, all hope is gone for me.} 24. Nd5 Rf3 {Still
trying to swarm in.} 25. Re4 Qh3 {I also considered 25...Qf5 threatening
to win the f2 pawn.  But, I knew that Carl would've stopped it with 26.Rf1.}
26. Qe2 {Nonetheless, he's going after my R.} Raf8 {Which is why I decide
to double up since f2 is attacked, and his next move was to be expected.}
27. Rf1 g5 {That's why I play this.  I'm thinking that if I can't use just
my Q or the R's, I might as well have help with my pawns.} 28. Ne3 {I was
surprised to see this move.  But, nothing stops my next move for the reason
that I mentioned earlier.} h5 29. Ng2 {I was surprised to see him play
this, but it allows me to come up with my g pawn, whereas before, he would've
taken it with his N.} g4 30. Re3 {Threatening to exchange.} Kg6 {?? I don't
do it right away since I know how powerful the monarch is in the endgame.
 But, this about to cost me a R for N, on top of, what I had already lost.}
31. Nh4+ Kg5 {That's why I continue moving up rather then moving down,
as 31...Kg7 also came into consideration.} 32. Nxf3+ gxf3 {I'm just not
quite ready to give up yet.  But, we're getting very close.} 33. Rxf3 {He's
also threatening to liquidate my Rf8.} Qg4 {That's why I decided to pin
his R.  In fact, I didn't think that white had a good move here.} 34. Qe3+
{But, I was wrong.  And, this is where I resigned as he's about to win
a free R.  The only way I can stop would be by giving up my Q for R.  Not
only that, but I've only got 12 minutes left against his 44.  So, there's
no hope left.  Even if Carl doesn't promote or have a mate, he would certainly,
win on time, to say the least.  When this game ended, after telling him
that I lost, Jack said, 'Now things are becoming interesting'.  And, he
was alluding to the tournament.  But, I don't know how interesting due
to a couple of oversights and by moving a little too quickly since I overlooked
the pin and was overly confident about a mating sequence that wasn't there.
 Even that, is a sign of moving too fast.}  1-0
