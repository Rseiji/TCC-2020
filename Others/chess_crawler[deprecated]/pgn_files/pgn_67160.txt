1. d4 d5 2. c4 Bd7 {Did black just block its defence of it pawn?} 3. cxd5
Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. dxe6 Bxe6 6. e4 {Better to play the calmer e2-e3} Bb4
7. Qa4+ {Poor, black’s knight will come to c6 solving blacks problems and
creating quite a few for white.} Nc6 8. Nge2 {That does not solve anything
and Black will soon have white in chaos.} Nxe4 9. a3 Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 Qf6
11. f3 Ng5 12. Qc2 {I } Bc4 13. Ng3 Bxf1 14. Kxf1 {White can no longer
castle, and that’s a real problem.} O-O-O 15. Bxg5 Qxg5 16. Ne4 Qf4 17.
Kf2 f5 18. Nc5 Nxd4 {Luckily white can play Qc2 with quite a few threats:
Qxb7 mate and Knight to e6 forking black rook and queen.} 19. Qb2 Nc6 {An
early Xmas present.} 20. Qxb7# {Checkmate. Black should have continued
15. ... Re8 giving it’s king an escape route. There is various calculations
to make. But I think white’s attack on black’s king will eventually peter
out, and black will finally be able to make white pay for its poor opening
play. Or maybe white has pulled off a magnificent feat of escapology. }
