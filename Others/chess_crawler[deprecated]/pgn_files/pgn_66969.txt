{I have been asked by one of the players to annotate this game, a rather
strange, strategic affair that could have gone either way until the balance
tilts towards the end.  Why this ended in a draw is a bit of a puzzle,
and one side was clearly winning come the final position.} 1. e4 c5 {We
begin with a Sicilian Defence - always good for a keen struggle.} 2. c4
{Rather an unusual option this early in the game.  By far the most popular
option is 2.Nf3, but moves like 2.d4, 2.Nc3, 2.f4 and even 2.b4 (Wing Gambit)
are options (Just the other day I watched GM Magnus Carlsen play the Wing
Gambit in a 'banter blitz' game).  } e6 3. Bd3 {Not a very good posting
for the bishop.  It has nowhere to go from d3, and is doing the menial
job the d-pawn could do better.  So 3.d3 would have been a better move.
 But White could equally well have played 3.Nc3 or 3.Nf3 or 3.g3, with
the idea 4.Bg2.  All those would have been good options.} d6 4. Ne2 {Quite
a good development this, having 0-0 and f2-f4 in mind.} Bd7 5. b3 {...}
Be7 6. Nbc3 Bc6 {A rather peculiar development of the bishop, but OK enough.}
7. Ba3 {Much better, in my view, would have been 7.Bb2, whence it would
be looking down the dark long diagonal towards g7 and h8.  The latent threat
would then exist of moving somewhere useful with the c3-knight, discovering
(i.e. uncovering) the bishop's attack: Bxg7.} b6 {'Overprotecting' c5,
a strongpoint White will find hard to break down.} 8. Qc2 {Good, for a
couple of reasons.  Lining up the Q and B like this along the b1-h7 diagonal
creates the potential for opening the line by e4-e5, and striking at h7...
WHEN the time is right, of course.} Bf6 {Black seems to dislike his knights!
 They aren't getting much of a look-in.  Better: 8.Nf6.} 9. Rb1 {Taking
the rook off the long diagonal and unpinning the c3-knight.  As the pin
was not especially onerous, I think I would have preferred 9.0-0, but there
is more purpose to White's actual choice than mere defence.} e5 {Closing
up the centre, and shutting down White's Q-B diagonal.  But there is a
downside to this move.  It's called d5.  } 10. b4 {A logical follow-up
to White's previous move.  Just as good would have been 10.Nd5.} Be7 {Not
a bad over-protective move! It also makes room for the knight to go to
f6.} 11. bxc5 {Again, a logical follow-up.  However there was something
to be said for 11.b5, with a bit of a bind on the Q-side.} b5 {(?? = terrible
move) I really don't understand Black's thinking here, as 11...bxc5 was
a simple and good recapture.  Now White has the chance to do some serious
damage.} 12. cxb5 {Of course!  This wins a second pawn, drives back the
bishop, and White gets a monster passed pawn on the 6th rank.} Bb7 13.
c6 {still on course.  Will Black be forced to 'undevelop' his queen's bishop?}
Bxc6 {Black decides that White's advanced pawns are too dangerous to live.
 A hard decision, but quite an understandable one!} 14. Bc4 {(?) Losing
the plot.  14.bxc6 simply won the piece at the cost of two pawns - but
more than that, it would have kicked off a tremendous attack: 14.bxc6 Nxc6
15.Bb5 ... (a lethal pin!) 15...Rc8  (The knight can not move, so needs
protection) 16.Nd5 Qd7 17.Rc1 ... Stacks on the Mill (remember that game
as a kid?)  White has now 3 pieces attacking the pinned knight, and Black
can find just two defenders.  So the knight would have fetched up in White's
pocket.} Bb7 15. O-O {Take a look at this position.  Even though White
hasn't made the best of her chances, she still has much the better of it
- much the more active game.  A good move here would be 15.Bd5, to exchange
one of Black's only active pieces, and to establish a knight on d5 (15.Bd5
Bxd5 16.Nxd5) where it would be threatening a knight-fork by 17.Nc7ch.
 Sometimes development has to wait upon realisation of opportunities.}
Bf6 {(?) Puts Bd5! back on the agenda?} 16. Qa4 {Best was 16.Bd5.  Not
a bad 'second best' move would have been 16.Qb3, striking towards f7. 
The move actually played is less good, and halves White's advantage.  The
threat is 17.b6ch.  What can Black do about it?} Ne7 {Not a heck of a lot,
as it happens.  This move is as good as any, but White still has the edge.
 } 17. Bb4 {I presume White had 18.Ba5 in mind.  But much stronger would
be the discovered check: 17.b6ch.  There's a cute trick to this: 17.b6ch
Bc6 (blocking the check and attacking the queen) 18.b7! Bxa4 19.bxa8=Q
... In effect the queen has been teleported from a4 to a8, and picked up
the rook!  So Black would have been better blocking the check with the
knight (17...Nc6), but White still gets a fine game starting 18.Nb5, threatening
the knight-fork on c7 (19.Nc7ch).} O-O {At last ducking the King into safety.
 } 18. d3 {Solid.  But 18.Qa3 would have taken aim at d6.} Nd7 {(?) Not
good, as it shuts off the Black queens protection of the d-pawn. White
should now have played 19.Bxd6.} 19. Qb3 {Eyeing f7.  But that is a fairly
long term target, when there are more lucrative pickings closer to hand.
 Better was Qa3, best was Bxd6.  E.g. 19.Bxd6 Nb6 (attacking the queen,
and a 'discovered' attack upon the bishop) 20.Qb4 protects both queen and
bishop.} a5 {Much better would have been 19...Nb6, reestablishing the queen's
protection over d6, and attacking the White bishop.  } 20. a4 {Quite unnecessarily
throwing away a useful bishop.  Once again 20.Bxd6 would have been great,
or White could have played this instead: 20.bxa6e.p. (en passant) Bxa6
21.Bxd6. } axb4 {Now all of White's good work so far has been undone, and
Black has the edge.} 21. Qxb4 Nc5 22. Ra1 {Good!  White still has some
fight left, and maybe something could be made of those two joined passed
pawns on the Q-side.} Nxd3 {(?) Returning the compliment!  Black throws
away a knight for a measly pawn.} 23. Qb1 {(?) Attacking the knight?  White
could have played 23.Bxd3 and reestablished her ascendancy.  Now the knight
can run away.  'Never trust your opponent', is one of my advices to developing
players.  If your opponent makes what looks like a mistake, never assume
it IS a mistake.  But never assume it ISN'T a mistake, neither.  Always
look to see what lies behind the enemy's move.  If there's nothing (i.e.
it is a mistake) then capitalize on it.} Nc5 24. a5 {(?) Premature.  For
the moment the pawns can't move.  Better might have been a move like 24.Rd1,
placing this rook on a more useful square - more useful as it's at the
base of a half-open file, and aims at the weak, backward pawn at d6.} d5
{Best was 24.Rxa5, but this central break has its points, too, ridding
Black of the weak backward pawn.} 25. exd5 Ng6 {(?) It looks as though
Black suddenly realised that recapturing on d5 would have been to White's
benefit, not Black's: [a] 25...Nxd5 26.Bxd5 Bxd5 27.Rd1, pinning and winning
the bishop; [b] 25...Bxd5 26.Nxd5 Nxd5 27.Rd1 Rxa5!  28.Rxd5 Rxa1 etc with
about a level game.  Casting about for an alternative, he comes up with
this, and gives White a chance...} 26. b6 {(?) Wrong pawn!  Instead, 26.a6
was the caper, forcing the bishop back 26...Bc8.  Then 27.b6 threatens
to advance the b-pawn to b7 with a pawn fork.  A series of exchanges ensue
on a6, whereat White fetches up with a giant pawn on b7.} Be7 27. a6 {Again,
premature.  White has the right strategic idea: push the passed pawns.
 But that assumes they can do so safely.  Black has three pieces covering
a6, White just two, so the pawn is simply lost, without levering open the
way for the other pawns.  Instead, playing 27.Rd1, putting some weight
behind White's THIRD passed pawn, would have offered White very good chances.
 Though a piece down, the three 'passers' would have been good for a roughly
even game. Pity.} Bxa6 {The knight capture was better, but this will do
for the edge for Black.} 28. Bxa6 Nxa6 {There are often tricks hidden in
the most obvious-looking positions.  Black should have taken with the rook.
 Now White can get something back using his b-pawn...} 29. Ne4 {Timing
can be everything.  The right move was 29.b7! attacking the rook: 29...Ra7
30.Qb5 ... and Black can't save the knight.  Picking up the b-pawn for
it, Black would have to settle for equality.} Nc5 {(!) Well played, Black!
 } 30. b7 {Rather a forlorn hope, now.  Even after 30.Rxa8 Qxa8 31.Nxc5
Bxc5 32.b7 ... The passed pawns are no longer the power they were earlier.}
Rxa1 {The right way.  Now the b-pawn falls.} 31. Qxa1 Nxb7 {Better 31....Nxe4
- the b-pawn was no longer much of a threat.} 32. Qb1 {32.Rd1 would have
preserved the life of the d-pawn.  But now the advantage lies firmly in
Black's hands.} Nd6 33. Nxd6 Qxd6 {A whole piece down, and nearing the
end game, White's prospects have faded away.  } 34. Qe4 {Better 34.Rd1,
to bring the rook into action.} f6 {More forceful would have been 34...f5.}
35. f3 {Weakening.  Better might have been something like 35.Rc1, with
the idea 36.Rc6 - give Black something to think about.} f5 {Good move -
driving White back.} 36. Qe3 f4 37. Qf2 {Too passive, and abandons the
d-pawn.  Better was 37.Qe4.} Qxd5 38. Nc3 Qc5 {Forcing off the queens.
 This is a well motivated exchange by Black, as the reduction in material
adds value to the material advantage he already has.  When defending material
down, it is generally in your interests to keep your pieces on the board
if you can; in the interests of your opponent to exchange them.  I say
'generally', as circumstances can alter priorities.} 39. Ne4 {Good post
for the knight.} Qxf2+ 40. Kxf2 {Not a bad recapture, to activate the King.}
Bb4 {Dominates White's knight, which has hardly anywhere it can go.  If
Black were to play ...h6, that knight would have no moves at all.} 41.
Nf6+ {(??) A 'nothing' move.  For a single checking move, White loses the
knight for nothing.  Movebound though it was, the knight ought to have
stayed on its good square, and the rook somewhere to the Q-side.} Rxf6
42. Ra1 h5 43. h4 {One forms the impression that the White player likes
to mimic her opponent's pawn moves.  In this game, such a habit has really
damaged her prospects.  This move (potentially) gives away the pawn for
nothing.} Ne7 {He could as well have played 43...Nxh4 44.Rh1 g5.  } 44.
Ra4 Bc5+ 45. Ke2 Be3 {Solid.} 46. Ra8+ Kf7 47. Ra5 {Threatening the loose
pawn at e5.} Re6 {Rather a passive posting for the rook, unless Black intends
to push the e-pawn.  I would probably have played 47.Nc6, here, attacking
the rook and protecting the e-pawn.  Then follow with 48...Rd6, or, if
47.Ra6??; Nd4ch 48Kd3 Rxa6.} 48. g3 {So dire is White's game now, that
it doesn't do to criticise a move that transforms a losing game into a
losinger game.  If 48...fxg3, White could get a piece back....} fxg3 {'Falling'
for it!  Objectively stronger was 48...Bb6.  But White still remains a
piece and two pawns down, with almost no worthwhile counter-play.} 49.
Ra1 {Why not 49.Kxe3 anyway?} Bf4 {Good enough, but I would have chosen
49...Nf5, here, threatening 50...g2 and 51...g1=Q.} 50. Kd3 Nf5 51. Ra7+
{What else can White play?  In fact this is no 'spite check' - there is
more to it than meets the eye,, as you will see...} Kg6 52. Ke4 Nxh4 {At
this point the game was abandoned as a draw, for reasons I am quite unable
to discover.  Having said that, suppose White were to play 53.Rb7 to which
Black replies 53...Rd6?? (53...Rc6 is way better). Then 54.Rxg7ch!! might
have drawn the game, as 54...Kxg7 is a draw by Stalemate.  Unfortunately,
Black can escape by 54...Kh6 55.Rh7ch Kg5! and if 56.Rh5ch Kg6 57.Rg5ch
Bxg5; or 56.Rg7ch Ng6. }  1/2-1/2
