1. b4 e5 {Considered the best reply to b4.} 2. Bb2 Bxb4 {Perhaps I jumped
the gun.} 3. Bxe5 Nf6 {i knew that this was the only reply that could prevent
a disaster for black.} 4. c3 {My opponent deftly attacked my bishop with
a kind of odd pawn move.} Be7 {I retreated to the best place i could find
on the board.} 5. d4 {My opponent was proceeding in getting up the board,
more that me, and, gaining space} h6 {A totally useless move. There was
no one attacking that square, at the moment.} 6. Nf3 d5 {Attempting to
gain some ground on my own.} 7. Nbd2 c5 {A little tactic i designed to
try to win a pawn.} 8. Qb3 c4 {The only move i could think of, and attacking
the queen at the same time. } 9. Qc2 Nc6 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. e4 {Confronting
my pawn.} O-O 12. exd5 Qxd5 {I didn't particularly want to develop the

that move, attacking the queen that way. } 22. Qh4 Qxh4 23. Nxh4 Nxd5 {The
