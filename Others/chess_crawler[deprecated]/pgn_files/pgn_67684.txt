{This really tested both my concentration on endgames. A fairly even opening
where White gets a slight material advantage that holds into the rook king
endgame. With a passed pawn, Black makes a seemingly harmless pawn advance
that could have had dire consequences, but White ends up trading his passed
pawn and exchanges rooks in the hope that his further advanced king will
eventually grant him victory. In the end, with both queens promoted on
the same move, a draw is most likely the outcome; however, White makes
a fatal slip and loses. } 1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. g3 {White is adopting
the quiet fianchetto bishop stance. Whilst there is more coverage, there
is less control of the centre. } d5 4. Bg2 Nf6 5. e3 Bc5 6. Ne2 e4 7. O-O
O-O 8. Bxf6 {8. d3 may have been better to try and drive away the strong
pawn at e4.} Qxf6 9. c3 {Developing the knight would have been easier to
meet the threat and to continue development and to not hamper the position}
Ne5 10. d4 Nf3+ {Black actually missed an opportunity to en passant at
d4. 10...exd3 e.p forces the knight away due to the protection of the knight
at e5.} 11. Bxf3 exf3 12. Nf4 Bd6 13. Qxf3 {A mistake, as Black can now
use of the pin by the unprotected queen. 13. Nxd5 was the better alternative
here.} Bxf4 {Black misses the chance to win a piece here with 13...g5}
14. exf4 Bf5 {A good idea to try and develop the bishop, but leaves his
d5 pawn unguarded. 14...c6 and then developing the bishop on the alternate
pawn islands would have been better.} 15. Qxd5 c6 16. Qf3 Qh6 {Possibly
better to try and maintain the attack was 16...Rae8. } 17. Nd2 Qh3 18.
Qg2 Qg4 19. Nc4 Rfe8 20. Nd6 Re7 21. Rae1 Rd7 22. Nxf5 Qxf5 23. Re5 Qd3
24. Qe4 Qxe4 25. Rxe4 {And now White, two pawns up, will try and convert
his material advantage into the endgame. } f6 26. Rfe1 Kf7 27. f5 Rad8
28. c4 b5 29. cxb5 cxb5 30. Rd1 Rd5 31. Rh4 {White could have tried for
31. Rc1, losing a pawn however, getting an exchange of rooks would allow
the c-rook access to Rc7+ and to take some pawns on the 7th rank.} h6 32.
Rc1 R8d7 33. b4 {White misses the loose pawn here on f5. 33. Rf4 is better.
} Rxf5 34. Rc5 Rfd5 35. Rxd5 Rxd5 36. a3 f5 37. Rf4 g5 38. Rf3 Kf6 {The
pawn advance 38...g4 to continue the attack on the rook and gaining tempo
would have been easier. } 39. Rd3 {White is desperately trying to hold
onto his passed pawn, but his other pawn islands are still yet to be developed,
which will be a major focal point later in the match. 39. g4 to stop Black's
own pawn islands advancing was best.} g4 40. Kg2 h5 41. h3 Kg6 {Black wants
to keep control of his pawn islands with his king, but they are in no immediate
danger, it is best to keep the King close to the passed pawn action. 41...Rd6
is safe, if White tries to advance with 42. d5, Black can interposed 42...Ke5}
42. f3 Kg5 43. h4+ Kf6 44. fxg4 fxg4 45. Kf2 Kf5 46. Ke3 a6 {With very
little moves left, Black makes a careless blunder. As per the previous
note 46...Rd6 is best. Now White can infiltrate Black's defenses. } 47.
Rc3 Rd6 48. Rc5+ Kg6 49. d5 {White misses the chance to go further with
49. Rg5+ forcing the king back to the centre with 49...Kf7. White will
take one of the pawns and create another passed pawn problem for Black.
Now Black gets a reprieve. } Kf5 {Black loses a tempo here as he is forced
to go back. 49...Kf7 is better, and then coming up to f6 when the White
king advances. } 50. Kd4 Rd7 51. d6+ {A discovered check, yes, but White
will lose his passed pawn. He will get a passed h-pawn, but in most circumstances
that gives Black more chances to draw. 51. Rc3 was easier, keeping the
initiative and forcing Black to waste tempo} Ke6 52. Rc6 {The most critical
move of the game, and this costs White the first half-point. Now that the
king is further to the pawn, capturing at h5 was actually better this time
as White's king is able to move in. Now with rooks off the board, it is
a draw with perfect moves.} Rxd6+ 53. Kc5 Rxc6+ 54. Kxc6 {Now we see the
importance of Black's pawns on the kingside. White will be able to capture
first on the queenside to create his passed pawns, but Black's are further
advanced. In any case it should be a draw.} Ke5 55. Kb6 Ke4 56. Kxa6 Kf3
57. Kxb5 Kxg3 58. Ka5 {A slight inaccuracy but nothing too drastic. The
a-pawn is better to be promoted first as there is less chance of a skewer.
Should still be a draw.} Kxh4 59. b5 g3 60. b6 g2 61. b7 g1=Q 62. b8=Q
Qc5+ {And now White should play 63. Ka4, where a draw is the likely outcome.
However....} 63. Ka6 {Black now takes the pawn with check, forces queens
off the board and promotes his last pawn where White is too far away to
catch it. } Qxa3+ 64. Kb7 Qb4+ 65. Kc8 Qxb8+ 66. Kxb8 Kg4 {A brutal and
exciting endgame that one move made all the difference! (White resigns).
}  0-1
