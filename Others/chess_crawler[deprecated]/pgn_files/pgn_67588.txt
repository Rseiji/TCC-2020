1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e3 {I like to recapture the pawn as quickly as possible,
and prefer this to 3.e4 or 3.Nf3} e6 {The other point of 3.e3 is that if
Black gets ideas of protecting the pawn with 3...b5 it loses and the Queen
has the option of going to f3, which can be very nasty for Black. But Black
is being sensible.} 4. Bxc4 {I take back my pawn. It's not really a gambit,
since Black can't hang onto it satisfactorily.} Nf6 {Now we both start
to develop.} 5. Nf3 Bb4+ {Probably a bit premature to my thinking, but
nothing really wrong with this.} 6. Bd2 Bxd2+ 7. Nbxd2 {Black has just
exchanged off the dark-squared Bishop for no great advantage, leaving me
ahead in development.} O-O {At least he gets his King away to safety.}
8. O-O {So do I.} Nc6 {Another developing move, though this Knight is possibly
better placed on d7, with b6 allowing the Bishop out onto b7. } 9. Rc1
{One of the drawbacks of accepting the pawn in the opening is it leaves
a half-open file for White's Rook.} Nd5 {Not quite sure where this Knight
is headed; there was still the option of 9...b6 to release the Bishop.
Now the h7 pawn is undefended, which doesn't matter for the moment, I guess.}
10. e4 {This wastes a tempo, I suppose, hitting the Knight right away,
but since the Knight must move it's not so important. Still, 10.Bd3, claiming
that nice diagonal, would have been better.} Nb6 {Now it's a long way back
to f6 for that Knight.} 11. Nb3 {Moving the e-pawn has left the d-pawn
inadequately defended, so I move the Knight to add to its defence.} Na4
{That Knight really is going walkabout. But this is a mistake, which I
miss and don't capitalise on.} 12. Rc2 {I simply defend the attacked pawn.
But 12.Bb5 was better, and if 12.Nxb2 13.Qc2 gives Black problems, attacking
the Knight and up the c-file.} a6 {Black should probably just admit the
Knight on a4 is misplaced and return it to b6. This gets ready to attack
my Bishop, I'm not planning on leaving it there anyway.} 13. Be2 {13.Bd3
is attractive, except for 13...Nb4 and there's a problem.} Ne7 {Presumably
getting ready for a Q-side pawn storm, but again, returning the misplaced
Knight to b6 was probably better.} 14. e5 {The computer prefers both 14.Qd2
or 14.Qd1 to this. But I'm eyeing the b1-h7 diagonal, and this blocks in
Black's light-squared Bishop from heading to the K-side. It does, however,
leave a nice hole on d5.} Nf5 {And of course, f5, though the computer options
all start with 14...f5, something I confess would not have appealed to
me had I been Black.} 15. Bd3 {Now I get onto that diagonal I have been
eyeing.} b5 {Getting ready to bring out the Bishop via b7, something that
maybe should have been done earlier. It does, however, leave the long diagonal
open for my own Bishop, which could sit nicely on e4 attacking the Rook
now.} 16. Nc1 {An opportunity I quite miss, starting a laborious transfer
of my Knight to the K-side. Now Black isn't so badly placed; he can put
his Bishop on the long diagonal himself.} g6 {I don't understand this.
Possibly a premature concern about my Queen going to h5 with a Knight on
g5? I don't know, but Black is creating a few weaknesses.} 17. Ne2 {On
its trek goes my Knight, again missing the chance for 17.Be4, allowing
Black to play 17...Bb7} Bb7 {And he does. Despite his misplaced Knight
on a4 he's not too badly off due to my passive and rather meandering play.
The game could be level.} 18. Nd2 {A serious error, leaving the d-pawn
undefended; 18...Nxd4 19.Nxd4 Qxd4 20.Be2 is not nice for me.} Qg5 {Definitely
a missed chance there by Black; although his position looks threatening
is a bit of bluster; 19.Ne4 soon shifts the Queen.} 19. g3 {It's a move
I quite miss, obvious though it is, panicking at the looming Queen} Qh6
{Black's c-pawn is undefended, but he is attacking, and nicking it was
probably unwise.} 20. Be4 {I decide I will get rid of that Bishop on the
long diagonal. I've noticed that I often place pieces on the right quare
at the wrong moment. Better to have put the Knight here now I imagine.}
Bxe4 {Success. Black can perhaps be forgiven for missing 20...Ne3 and if
21.fxe2 Qxe3+ keeps his attack going. I certainly missed it. Certainly
better than surrendering his best placed piece.} 21. Nxe4 Rac8 {Black defends
the backward pawn. He might have been better counter-attacking my own pawn
with 21...Rad8 maybe?} 22. Nf6+ {Why this, instead of the preferred (by
the computer) 22.Qd3? I just thought that with Black's Bishops gone it
would take a lot of jumping for a Knight to shift this piece from here,
and in the meantime it was sure to be able to cause trouble somehow.} Kg7
{Probably better on h8 where the Knight can't check it again.} 23. b3 {Once
again my play is rather laborious, driving away a piece that's doing me
no harm when I could have carried on attacking, maybe with 23.h4 or 24.Qd3.}
Nb6 {Back to where it probably would have gone anyway at some time.} 24.
Nf4 {I'm trying to link up my Knights so that they protect one another,
but I'm rather losing momentum in the process.} Rfd8 {Black is aware of
the potential problems d5 might cause. And I'm aware of the potential problems
of having a Rook facing my Queen..} 25. Qc1 {So I move, and concentrate
on hitting the weak c-pawn, giving up the d-pawn, which I feel, incorrectly,
is going to fall sooner or later anyway. Doubling up on the d-file with
25.Rd2 was better. In effect, I have embarked on the wrong plan...} Nxd4
{Black says thank you very much...} 26. Rxc7 {So do I! Now Black comes
up with an inspired tactic that changes the face of the board...} Qxf4
{At first I thought this was a blunder and I had won. Then I saw that whether
I capture with the Queen or the g-pawn Black has 27...Ne2 to win back the
material. And my pawns are shattered. Clever.} 27. gxf4 {Taking with the
pawn seems best, since after 27.Qxf4 Ne2+ followed by 28...Nxf4 I have
to capture with the pawn and my pawns are messed up anyway.} Ne2+ {Here
we go...} 28. Kh1 Nxc1 {Black has successfully turned the game around.
Now I agonised over which Rook to use to recapture. I didn't fancy Black's
Rook penetrating to my second rank after 29.Rfxc1 Rxc7 30.Rxc7 Rd2, but
Black can do this anyway. But I thought I'd made the right decisison.}
29. Rcxc1 Rxc1 30. Rxc1 Rd4 {Black starts to harry my pawns, though attacking
this one with the Knight by 30...Nd5 is better.} 31. Rc6 {Rather driving
the Knight to a better square, but the game is evenly balanced now and
who knocks off which pawns may be vital; the pawn on f4 looks lost anyway,
so I aim at compensating by winning the a-pawn.} Nd5 32. Nxd5 {Probably
forced - 32...Nxf6 33.exf6 Kxf6 is too horrible to contemplate. My nicely
placed Knight on f6 didn't actually do any damage after all!} exd5 {Now
Black has a passed pawn. Trouble looming, I feel.} 33. Rxa6 {Still, I have
the potential for a passed pawn on the Q-side now, something that turns
out to be crucial with the Black King a long way away. Since the f-pawn
is doomed I could perhaps have given it up on f5 and messed up Black's
pawns, but I didn't think of it.} Rxf4 {Instead, Black gets it with his
Rook.} 34. Kg2 {Vital, obviously. Now we're into one of those endgames
where I really don't know the best way forward, but I suspect neither does
my opponent. We both have loose pawns up for grabs, and 34...Rd4, defending
one, or 34...b4, stopping the advance of my a-pawn are good options. Or
he could just push the passed pawn forward. In retrospect, Black might
have been better with 34...b4.} Re4 {Instead he attacks my pawn.} 35. Rb6
{And I attack his!} Rb4 {Not his best option. 35...b4, 35...Rg4+ and 35...Re2
were all better. I'm sure neither of us knew that. Now 36.h4 is probably
my best bet, since 36...Rxh4 37.Rxb4 is okay for me. But the dubious position
of the Black Rook has me wondering whether it can be trapped, if I can
get my Rook back to defend my b-pawn?} 36. e6 {So I give up my e-pawn to
get my Rook back into play. I feel it's going to be more use defending
than attacking right now....} fxe6 37. Rxe6 Kf7 {Black drives my Rook away,
but it was moving anyway. I could, and probably should, go back to b6,
but the plan is in my head...} 38. Re3 {Defending the b-pawn so I can push
the a-pawn forward. But really the Black Rook has lots of escape squares,
and this is a hopeful plan at best. 38...Rg4+ gets it out of the hole immediately,
for example.} Kf6 {But Black decides his KIng is needed eventually, so
why not now? Still the game could go either way.} 39. a3 {I carry on with
Plan A and drive away the Rook.} Rd4 {Black defends his passed pawn, but
frustratingly his Rook is in front of it. It still doesn't have too may
safe squares, something I'm wondering whether Black has missed.} 40. Kf1
{Avoiding the possible check on g4. It's a tight situation. I felt I was
losing control of the game, though the computer suggests the position is
level.} Kf5 {The Black King closes in. Who is really best here? I do not
know.} 41. Rf3+ {I think I can keep the King out; he won't want my Rook
getting behind his pawns. (Where it was not so long ago!)} Ke4 {Will he?}
42. Re3+ {But I really did not fancy 42.Rf7 and kept on with the checks.}
Kf5 43. Ke2 {I feel my King has to be more involved; the h-pawn is a little
loose but 43...Rh4 can be met with 44.h3. We're both walking a tightrope
where the slightest slip....} h5 {The Black pawns start to move....} 44.
Rd3 {I decide to try for the draw by repetition. I don't like the look
of the position, though analysis reveals it to be still in the balance.}
Re4+ 45. Re3 Rd4 46. Rd3 {It's looking like a draw, and I will be relieved
as I can't see anything better and I'm pretty sure an exchange will seal
Black's fate once I play a4 and get his King chasing a passed pawn on the
K-side. But he surprises me...} Ke5 {I thought I had won here, but analysis
shows the game is not over yet even after the exchange...} 47. Rxd4 Kxd4
48. a4 {Off goes my pawn...} bxa4 49. bxa4 {Now, Black will chase the a-pawn
while my King can get to his own pawns, the first being the dangerous one
on d5. And that's just what happens....} Kc4 {Probably the crucial error:
49...g5 keeps the game level. Now he's probably lost unless I mess up.
I didn't know that at the time, of course: 49....g5 50.a5 Kc5 51.Ke3 g4
52.a6 Kb6 53.Kd4 Kxa6 54.Kxd5 Kb5 55.Ke6 Kc4 56.Kf6 Kd4 57.Kg5 Ke4 was
beyond my calculation.} 50. a5 Kb5 51. Kd3 {Both a-pawn and d-pawn will
fall, but my King is nearer to Black's pawns than his is to mine.} Kxa5
52. Kd4 Kb4 53. Kxd5 Kc3 54. Ke5 Kd3 55. Kf6 Ke2 56. Kxg6 h4 57. f4 {Now
my pawn will Queen.} Kf3 58. f5 Kg2 59. f6 Kxh2 60. f7 h3 {Trying to get
into a stalemate position . It should be won now, but I must still be wary.
I've stalemated players in simpler positions, believe it or not!} 61. f8=Q
Kg1 62. Qc5+ Kg2 63. Qd5+ Kg1 64. Qd1+ Kg2 65. Qg4+ Kh2 {And here Black
resigned, realizing that after I move my King he must give up the pawn
and mate will follow. (Mate is actually quicker without taking the pawn,
but I would have taken it.) Quite a tight endgame I felt rather fortunate
to win in the end.}  1-0
