{This was an interesting game between me and Master Nathan.  Actually,
it was my first Walking the Walk Game in a long while, and it remains as
my most recent one.  In fact, this game occurred, about 2 months, before
the tournament began again.  It was well deserved with how I mentored Erika
in her annotations.  And, in doing so, I talked the talk again.  It's even
more unique because, nowadays, I'm the only person that has these WTW games,
and it's not even online.  So, it wasn't how it was originated where you
play an expert or master who you've never met before.  Here it's someone
I know, but besides that, it ends up following the other original WTW rules,
or what we call, the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules.  As I didn't
resign but was rather, checkmated in this game in a R odds game against
someone who is about Fred's strength.} 1. e4 {I'm generally not sure what
Nathan does.  But, I do have an idea when he plays as white.  As there's
a pawn that he generally gives up, and then a second as a gambit to see
what I'll do.  I'll get to that later, but in the meantime, I, as usual,
continue with the Sicilian.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 {As I was preparing
for the Nadjorf Sicilian.} 4. c3 {Not surprisingly, Nathan plays this first.
 I usually just take but decided to delay it.  As after 4...cxb3, I once
played 5...cxb2 right away.  That allowed him to do everything with his
Bc1 right away, do the entire fianchetto right away.  And, when that happened,
he was then able to develop all of his pieces at once which gave him a
winning advantage, as I was behind in development.  So, I decided not to
waste anytime in getting my N out.} Nf6 5. e5 {That is, until he played
this.} dxe5 {I didn't want to retreat here, but it might have been better
then what I played.  As after 5...Nd5 my N's centralized and am beginning
to get ahead in center control.  But, by playing this, Nathan will have
a small advantage as he'll have a little more space in the center.} 6.
Nxe5 dxc3 {?? Not knowing what else to do here, I played this.  I didn't
want to become too analytical either, as then, I'd start feeling overwhelmed,
and might even start rushing which would cost it.  But, so does this move.
 At first, I thought that the worst that happens is that Nathan exchanges
and takes away my castling rights.  However, black's situation becomes
a lot worse.  Much better would've been 6...Qb6, and even though I don't
like bringing the Q out early, it would've been necessary here since the
Q would be on the same diagonal as his c3 pawn.  As after we exchange Nathan
will fork and win back the R.  And, once you let someone a runner like
this fully compensate for lost material, it's pretty much, curtains for
the walker.  TA emphasized it during one of his blitz Q sac lectures. }
7. Qxd8+ Kxd8 8. Nxf7+ Ke8 9. Nxh8 cxb2 {And, with that, I take right here.
 This should've waited as now Nathan can do an entire fianchetto in just
one move become way ahead in development which is a further advantage to
him.} 10. Bxb2 e6 {Preparing to develop my Bf8.  But, my idea behind this
is to trap his Nh8, as Mariann did to me when I coached her in our first
training session.} 11. Bd3 {Continuing with his development.  } Bb4+ {Trying
to take advantage of whatever weakness I think he's got, I played this.
 My thinking was that it, automatically, stops him from castling.  In this
case, it did, but my assessment was wrong.  Forgetting that his Nb8 and
Bb7 are protecting each other, this runner, of course, could've gotten
out with 12.Bc3 or 12.Nc3  In fact, as white, I would've answered with
12.Nc3, but Nathan, on the other hand, used his K.  Thus, he willfully,
gives up castling anyhow.  That means that he's already starting to calculate
a win against me.} 12. Ke2 Kf8 {And, with that, I work on trying to trap
his Nh8, as noted earlier.  I didn't see how he was going to get out of
this, but I was, of course was wrong and had more to learn from.} 13. Rc1
{As Nathan goes after my Bc1, first.} Nc6 {And, I stop him for now.} 14.
Bb5 {So, the runner goes after my Nc6 instead.  } Ne7 {And, I also stop
him.} 15. Rc4 {And, that's when he targets my B.  But, I show that I'm
still not afraid of him on my next move.  The truth is that I should be.}
Bd6 16. Rh4 {So, he goes after my h2.  The idea is that if I don't watch
out, he'll exchange his Bb2 for my Nf6 which will allow him to get my pawn.}
Kg8 {But, I don't negate the other threats by going after his Nh8, instead.
 In fact my thinking was that, no matter Nathan does now, the N is trapped
and can't get out.  That would work against most player, but it won't against
Nathan because he's too experienced.} 17. Bd3 {And, that's why he attacks
h7 again.  } g6 {?? I should've just taken because I forgot that if 17...Kxh8
18.Bxh7 or 18.Rxh7+ I can answer with 18...Nxh7  What I forgot is that
everything was protected by my N on f6 due to Tunnel Vision, as I was worried
about everything else that was occurring against my monarch.  But, this
is the losing move.  If I had taken back, I would've recompensated for
lost material.  It would've have been, as good as, not giving back my R,
but I'd still keep a R, and be a piece up.  By playing this, Nathan can
and will stop me from getting winning anything else, which means that he'll
straight up out play me.} 18. Bxf6 Nf5 {That's why I go after Rh4, instead.
 But, I forgot about his Bd3 which will allow Nathan to further liquidate.
 Better would've been to swing at his Bf6 with 18...Nd5.} 19. Bxf5 gxf5
20. Rd4 {In addition Nathan is attacking my Bd6 to drive into a passive
position.  } Bf8 {A better try would've been to attack with 20...Bc5 with
the idea that if 21.Bc4 21...Bb6 leaves it protected and prevents the upcoming
pin that's about to occur.} 21. Rd8 h5 {Already starting to think about
a pawn promotion, I advance.} 22. Nc3 {Completing his development.} b6
{Without anything else to lose, I do something very unusual which I've
corrected one of my students for.  It's a double fianchetto with both in
 a row.  If I weren't lost, I would've refrained, but my goal is to just
get my LSB into play, right away.} 23. Nb5 {I'm not sure what Nathan is
trying to prove here with his N.} a6 {But, not taking chances, I chase
it away.  } 24. Nc7 {I figured that he'd played this and was prepared since
my Ra8 is protected.  But, I forgot that my e6 pawn isn't.} Rb8 25. Nxe6
Bxe6 {Thinking that I just won back a piece, I took.  I forgot that my
B was half pinned to my R, and by playing this, Nathan now gets ahead.}
26. Rxb8 Bc4+ {But, getting angry about what I didn't realize, I try to
become a Mr. tough guy for counterplay by delivering this check.} 27. Kd2
Bxa2 {This is also why I grabbed here.  And, I'm keeping in mind is that
I don't lose a piece because as we know, his Ra1 was the only piece that
wasn't in the game, since Nathan did R odds.  However, that's still not
good enough when you consider that he's ahead.  In this case, he's a R
for P up.  And, this move will just get him a pawn which means that they
were exchanged.  But, it's about to get worse for me.} 28. Rxb6 Bg7 {As
I try to trap his N again by attacking it twice.} 29. Rb8+ {And, Nathan
stops it by throwing in the check.} Kh7 30. Rb7 Kxh8 {It was mate either
way, but thinking that I now had the opportunity that I missed earlier
to get the N, I take it once and for all.  This would've been better much
earlier.  But, by playing this, Nathan has a mate in 2 which he will take
advantage of and will even announce checkmate at the end of it.  At first,
I didn't think that his very last move, but it is since it's a mating as
the K is trapped and will have no way out.} 31. Rxg7 Bg8 32. Rf7#  1-0
