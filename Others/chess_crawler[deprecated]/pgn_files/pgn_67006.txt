1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 {I hate the exchange variation - I love
the French because of the play in the center but this just opens it up.
Coincidentally its what I play as white against the French for that very
reason. } 4. Nf3 Nc6 {This isn't mainline as far as I know - I saw it had
a good record with the database so I figured I'd take a crack at it - it's
a little odd feeling being a French player and restricting the C pawn.
} 5. Bb5 Bd6 6. c4 dxc4 7. d5 a6 8. Ba4 b5 9. dxc6 bxa4 {This got real
gross and I gave up pawn structure for a temporary pawn but with one to
capture. I think it'll be fine if I win the race for development while
tending pawns.} 10. O-O Ne7 11. Nbd2 Be6 12. Qxa4 c3 {Looking for takes,
I castled, Bd5 then takes but of course he could not take which is what
happens.} 13. Ne4 {In retrospect here I should've take b2 and opened up
that lane rather than letting him take - I preferred to not let him point
to kingside and wanted to finishing developing but now on mover 14 I'm
seeing that's not optimal. } O-O 14. Nxc3 {So I'm down a pawn entering
the middle game - the middle is torn asunder and he has slightly more of
a command of it with his knights. General plan of attack is I need his
pawn on c6 to stay competitive. Similarly I think his best plan is to target
c7 via moves like Bf4, Ne4 and Rc1. Ultimately I like my bishop pair with
the open board but it'll be hard to limit his knights. Qe8 seems challenges
the pawn but Nd4 defends and challenges my bishop straight away. Projected
line of 14. ... Qe8 15. Nd4 Nd5 16. Re1 Nxc3 17. bxc3 seems okay but doesn't
terribly get me closer to my objectives. Qb1 seizes an open column and
lets tickle a potential target on b2. } Qb8 15. Nd4 Nd5 16. Nxd5 Bxd5 17.
Nf5 {Interesting move - obviously threatening Nxd6 which would help the
advancement of the c6 pawn. Be5 seems natural to challenge b2 but he's
threatening Ne7+ to take Bd5. I think Qb6 wins the pawn back temporarily
with 18. Nxd6 Bxc6 and he does not appear to have any inbetween moves but
19. Qf4 or any number of Q moves appear to get the d6 pawn back after the
exchange. Still I'd rather get the pawn off c6, get rid of my backward
pawns and start seizing open lanes for counter play. } Qb6 18. Qg4 {Threatening
mate on g7; Be5 centralizes my bishop and protects but presumably he follows
up with Bh6. I'm assuming secondary target following g6 is exchange knight
and push pawn on the c file. Alternatively he might see a mating net I'm
missing. } g6 19. Nxd6 cxd6 20. Bh6 Rfe8 21. Qg5 {So this is crushing -
I saw all three threats but I can't stop them - I need to get the Q on
the A1-H8 diagonal but there's no way to do it without losing the bishop
or letting the pawn push. Even if I manage to prevent the mate threat via
something like   21.	Qg5	Qd4 22.	Rfd1	Qe5 23.	Rxd5	Qxg5 24.	Bxg5	Rac8 25.
Rxd6	  I'm still down a full piece and two pawns. }  *
