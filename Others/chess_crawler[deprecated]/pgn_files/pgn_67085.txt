1. e4 e5 2. f4 {The King's Gambit is nowadays by many thought to be an
'unhealthy' opening, and it is indeed hardly ever used nowadays among grand
masters. In the past, however, it was often the theme of truly magnificent
chess games, such as this one between Paul Morphy and Adolf Anderssen https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1019060
} Nc6 {2. ...Nc6 is a weak (too non-aggressive) move that immediately favours
White. Taking the offered pawn (2. ...exf) seems to be the best response
by far, followed by the double-gambit 2. ...d5, which is more rarely played.
} 3. Nf3 {This is the only natural move for White adding pressure on e5}
Bc5 {Whilst seemingly aggressive, this move gives away a pawn without sufficient
compensation} 4. fxe5 Nxe5 {This is indeed the correct reply} 5. Nxe5 {This
back capture is probably not the best move (because of 5. ...Qh4+), but
at the time I thought it would keep the excitement high! 5. Be2 was probably
much better.} Qh4+ {This is an excellent counter and in many ways equalises
the position.} 6. g3 {Note that 6. g3 is the only move! 6. Ke2 had resulted
in checkmate by 6. ...Qxe4++ } Qxe4+ {Again, by far the best move and White
appears to be in big trouble despite his material advantage} 7. Qe2 {This
is the only rescue (with any honour). The alternative, 7. Be2, had led
to 7. ..Qxh1 8. Bf1 Qxh2 etc with a win for black} Qxh1 {Again the best
move, and it might seem at first sight that the game is lost by White.
However, 'when hardship is at its worst, rescue is close' (as the saying
goes)....} 8. Ng6+ {This 'revealed' check is the only move that keeps the
game equaL} Ne7 {8. ...Ne7 is probably best. Be7 was the only other feasible
alternative} 9. Nxh8 {The obvious 'retaliation'. The position is now probably
close to equal despite White's two pawn material advantage! This is due
to White's difficult King position.} b6 {Unfortunately, this is a very
small step that loses the game. The idea is clear, fianchetto of the LSB,
but timing is poor and allows White to develop. 9. ...d5 had been much
better with control of the centre and still allowing freedom for the LSB.}
10. Nc3 {Developing on the Q side} Bb7 {Logical follow-up from b6} 11.
d4 {11. d4! is an important resultant of the previous Nc3. Black cannot
now take the pawn because of Nb5 and the double threat of taking the bishop
and check at c7.} Bb4 {Black clearly sees the danger and pins the White
knight instead. However, Black has now lost an important asset, viz. INITIATIVE!
The two-pawn low in material is more academic as long as the White knight
at h8 is 'trapped'.} 12. Bd2 {A natural response} Bxc3 13. Bxc3 Bf3 {A
dangerous looking move, but with little or no actual effect. Instead, it
may have been good to go after the trapped white knight.} 14. Qf2 {This
is a stong move threatening check at f7} Nd5 {An excellent attack on the
White BSB} 15. Kd2 {...which needs to be protected by an active function
of the White King} Kf8 {Black moves towards killing of the knight, but
there is a 'problem' which is why Nf6 had been better} 16. Nxf7 {This is
now possible (with the Black knight at d5), because if Black takes with
his King, White moves Bc4!!} Nxc3 {This leaves the Black King vulnerable}
17. bxc3 Kg8 18. Ng5 {The cornered White knight is unexpecteldly free!}
Bd5 19. Bc4 {19. Bc4! is a good move. If the Black Queen takes the rook
at a1, Bxd5+ and checkmate in three moves} Rf8 20. Qe2 {The Black Queen
still should not take the rook because of the mate threat} Qxa1 {Black
still takes the rook, which is the beginning of the end} 21. Bxd5+ Kh8
{Note that 21. ...Rf7 had resulted in immediate mate Qe8++} 22. Nf7+ Kg8
23. Qf3 {Further analysis shows that 23. Qe7 had been more effective} g6
{g6 is a very clever way of trying to get out of the trouble} 24. Qf6 Qe1+
{This is obviously just a slow-down} 25. Kxe1 Re8+ 26. Ne5+ Re6 27. Qf7+
Kh8 28. Qf8# {An interesting try at the King's Gambit and its strengths
and fallacies.}  1-0
