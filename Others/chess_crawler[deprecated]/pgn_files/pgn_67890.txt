{The game which introduced Alekhine's Gun. A game from the San Remo tournament
of 1930. Annotations by R. N. Coles.} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5
{Seizing space in the manner of Tarrasch. } c5 {The traditional counter.
} 5. Bd2 Ne7 6. Nb5 Bxd2+ 7. Qxd2 O-O 8. c3 {Constructing the pawn chain
in the Classical manner. } b6 {Attempting to solve the problem of the bad
QB. } 9. f4 Ba6 10. Nf3 Qd7 11. a4 {Resolutely resisting the exchange of
B's. } Nbc6 {Intending (with ...Kt-R4) to seize the white squares. } 12.
b4 cxb4 13. cxb4 Bb7 {The plan for this Bishop has been defeated by simple,
logical play. } 14. Nd6 f5 15. a5 Nc8 {15...PxP would allow 16 P-Kt5 Kt-Q1
17 RxP, with a huge gain in space. } 16. Nxb7 Qxb7 17. a6 Qf7 18. Bb5 {It
is White who triumphs on the white squares, and he can also seize the open
QB file at his leisure. } N8e7 19. O-O h6 20. Rfc1 Rfc8 21. Rc2 Qe8 {Allowing
a fatal pin on QB3. But 21... Kt-Q1 is no better: it allows 22 R/1-QB1
RxR 23 RxR R-B1 24 RxR KtxR 25 Q-B3 Kt-K2 26 Q-B7, and White has an easy
win. } 22. Rac1 Rab8 23. Qe3 Rc7 24. Rc3 Qd7 25. R1c2 Kf8 26. Qc1 Rbc8
27. Ba4 {White now threatens P-Kt5, forcing the Black Knight away, and
winning a piece on QB7. To meet this, Black has begun bringing his King
over, but as the King would arrive too late, a pawn must now be given up
to gain time. } b5 28. Bxb5 Ke8 29. Ba4 Kd8 {The King has arrived, and
now 30 P-Kt5 Kt-QKt1 would not win White a piece on QB7. } 30. h4 {Black
suddenly realizes he is in Zugzwang. Nothing can be moved except the K
side Pawns, and they will soon have no moves left. Then the only move will
be ...Q-K1, after which P-QKt5 will win a piece on QB7 after all. So Black
resigns. }  1-0
