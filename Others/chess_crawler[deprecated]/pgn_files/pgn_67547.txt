1. e4 {A quick 10 move game that illustrates some of the pitfalls of eating
too much material when facing the Traxler. The King in particular eats
well, but dies with a full belly....} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {A familiar
first few moves } 4. Ng5 {White advances the knight to threaten blacks
pawn on f2} Bc5 {Black ignores the threat and lines up his own attack the
white f2 pawn } 5. Nxf7 {White takes the pawn on f7 and forks blacks queen
and knight. Not the best move for white....but letâ€™s see how it works out}
Bxf2+ {Black hits back with a capture on f2 checking the king} 6. Kxf2
{The hungry king takes the bishop and is now exposed to a range of potential
attacks} Nxe4+ {The black knight jumps in} 7. Ke3 {And the king starts
to move up the field } Qh4 {The queen joins the action and white needs
to play carefully to avoid the gathering storm} 8. Nxh8 {White presses
on with the material advantage, but eight move in all is lost} Qf2+ {The
king is forced to continue his march} 9. Kxe4 {Again white claims material
advantage by chewing up the knight} d5+ {The lawn checks the king, forks
the bishop and frees up blacks dangerous LSB} 10. Bxd5 {Whites final mistake}
Bf5# {The game is over with 11 of the white pieces still unmoved.  }  0-1
