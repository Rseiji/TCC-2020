{As with my Wizard Chess Game that I annotated, I have more voting tonight
with American Idol where I'll have to use Sunglasses due to the blue ray
lights, combined with having to work tomorrow.  It'll determine who makes
it to the Finale, and by then, I just hope I know right then and there
who I'm voting to get rid of this small mess.  Having said that, I am not
completely happy with the show right now, to make a long story short. 
It also doesn't matter if I don't finish the annotation today because there's
more voting with sunglasses needed tomorrow night and for shorter while
the next day to vote on The Voice.  Having said that, I would've another
Wizard Chess game as black at the easiest level followed by an annotation
for the mental workout.  But, I just learned that Joann passed away from
cancer.  To make matters worse, she was, about, the same age as GM Susan
Polgar which hits me harder.  So, annotating this long game isn't just
tiring out, but it's also in Joann's memory.  I remember our days because
in the beginning of my kibitzing, very shortly after I argued about 1.Rf8!
being the solution with stalemate to come in Judit Polgar's puzzle, I showed
off on GK.  That was, right before my first loss against her husband, Fred.
 I first, had a lucky draw by rep, followed by a win on time.  My guess
is that right before the Master Mater wanted that WTW challenge where I'd
lose, since she annotated that game and called it, 'Back with a Vengeance',
the master mater asked her to take on me.  As the idea was still seeing
how tough I was, and I really showed my inexperience to her.  The game
started about a week, after I kibitzed in that puzzle with Judit where
she stopped posting solutions shortly after that.  The only reason I know
how long is that I annotated the game, about a month later since the game
took about 2 weeks.  So, I was black against Joann, who at the time, was
jstevens1.  And, it started off with 1.e4 c5 2.f4 a6 3.Nf3 d6 4.Nc3 Qa5?
where I didn't care about General Opening Guidelines then.  And, the reason
I gave that a queiry is because bhidragon rightly said, 'The Queen comes
out too soon for no valid reason. Stevens will base her entire attack against
this one mistake. She'll be able to develop against the open Queen and
keep Black from getting pieces into play.'  But, sometime later she played
against someone like this opponent and won.  Her goal was to play against
someone of, at least, Expert level (based on ELO) and win.  Before this,
she won against players her strength and lower.  But, at best, she got
expert draws online.  And, once Joann accomplished her goal that's when
she would change her username to jotheblackqueen.  That's just like when
I changed my username due to the negative accomplishment.  Having said
that, this game also reminds of the game that IM Alisa Melekhina annotated
with her win against GM Alexander Shabalov.  Given that Joann defeated
much stronger opposition makes this game more interesting.} 1. Nf3 {I remember
that 1.Nc3 would be the Dunst Opening.  But, I don't remember what this
is called, but I do know that it's a common opening.  In fact, back in
the day, not too long before my first training game with bhidragon, I used
to open this way.  He asked me why and didn't like it.  But, I stopped
because of Coach Stockel.  I hate to say, but he told me not to play this
first move for the wrong reason, as well.  It was also a cornerstone to
me becoming overly critical of something like Nimzovich-Larsen Attack.
 As Jack specifically said that I should not play this opening.  Instead,
I should open with something like 1.e4.  Similar to what I once said about
the Larsen attack, Jack told me that the reason for this is because 1.Nf3
is not analyzed by Master or GM's.  The reason is because this move, supposedly,
destroys the center, prevents you from controlling the center.  It was
much later on, I believe 6-12 months before I became overly critical that
I learned that they, absolutely, study and play 1.Nf3.  Despite still being
pompous, That was when I first realized and accepted that my main mentor
is not always correct.  To be exact, it was around the same time that Fred
departed from GK. } d5 {It's obvious that 1...e5? is unplayable.  As such,
I would've answered with 1...Nc6, to safely 2...e5  But, I see why Martin
played this, and back in the day, I would've done the same.  As this is
probably a better way to develop since it is a center pawn.  And, that
brings him a step closer to controlling the center since, ideally, you
want the e4, e5, d4, d5 squares occupied with pieces around it.  Before
I watched a video, I was wondering when the center was considered controlled,
but I recently learned that this is when.} 2. d4 {Which makes this the
natural follow up.} Bf5 {With the same idea.  I would like 2...Nc6, if
black didn't open with 2...d5.  As such, I would play this move with the
idea to later play ...Nd7, where I don't have to worry about blocking the
c pawn.  But, there's always more to a game then meets the eye.} 3. c4
{This is an interesting move.  But, from the context of how this was played,
combined with, what I've seen before, this is a transposition of the QG.
 As after the Queens Gambit, I saw 3.Nf3 Bf5.} e6 {And, with we've also
transposed into the QGD.} 4. Nc3 {And, I can see why Joann did this since
the idea was getting her Nb1 into play.  And, I would also have a preference
for the N to arrive on c3 then on d2 where it appears to have more mobility.}
Bb4 {Having said that, I'm not surprised to see Martin pin.  If I were
playing this, I wouldn't see the point since I'd respond with 5.Bd2.  There's
also something like 5.a3 which nuntar and Ken once pointed out.  But, I
like Joann's response even more since it appears that Martin's K side pawn
structure will be affecting before he's able to castle.  Having said that,
however, I like this move better since after Bf4, if we didn't have this
pin, white would be able to a nasty threat with Nb5 later on.  As now,
a R fork is really threatened since the N would be protected by the B.
 This way, it can't do any damage.  } 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bf4 {Continuing with
her development.} Nf6 {As does Martin.} 7. Qb3 {Going right after the B,
but I don't know what else.  On the other hand, I like Martin's response
since I would've retreated which would just lose a tempo.  Whereas, black
is continuing with his development.} Nc6 8. e3 {Opening up a line for her
Bf1.  If Joann's center is not completely controlled, then it's very near
it at this point for the reason outlined earlier.} Bd7 {Preventing the
pin on his Nc6.  But, I, on the other hand, would've allowed it as I'd
be keeping in mind that this move is avaliable, once white pins.  Having
said that, I would've castled here.} 9. Bd3 {Continuing with her development
and preparing to do that, later on.  Having said that, I'm not surprised
to see Martin castle on his next move.} O-O 10. Rc1 {This was played as
now, Joann is threatening to do damage with 11.a3  As now, she can use
the R if black captures.  And, I guess this makes the R more mobile since
Martin will retreat on his next move.  This means, that the B goes from
less to more mobile which is no wonder why black doesn't want to exchange
now.} Bd6 11. Bg5 {This is why Joann counterpins.} Be6 {I don't see the
point behind this move since there's an interference where the B is blocked
by the d5 pawn.  But, I like Joann's next move, and it would be very difficult
for me to decide.  As I'd be torn between 2 candidate moves, being white's
play or 12.Qxb7  But, I probably would've chosen the latter due to how
easy it is to get greedy.  However, I realize that this would be a mistake
since Joann doesn't capture right away.} 12. O-O Rb8 {But, that was the
plan behind the last move.  This means that if she had played 11.Qxb7,
Martin would've found a way to expose the monarch.  As now, it would be
possible which is why he protects.} 13. a3 {Preventing 13...Nb4 which would
attack the Bd3 and drive it to a less active square.} a6 {And, Martin has
the same idea in mind.} 14. Rfe1 {Centralizing her R.} Kh8 {I would not
see the point of this move if my coach told me that, in general, you want
to bring your monarch to the corner, sometime, after you castle.  That
was when I lost to him in what, I believe, was a WTW game since he had
mating sequence, if I recall correctly.  However, I thought that he was
also incorrect about that, until this game given that Martin just did it.}
15. Bb1 {I do not see the point behind this move since it appears to undevelop
the B.  If I were playing this game and was given this position, I'd answer
with 15...Na5, in hopes that white would play 16.Qc2 or 16.Qd1, with which,
I'd then play 16...Nc4.  But, I'm pretty sure that, instead, white would
quick play 16.Qa2 to keep the pressure on since I saw something similar
with Ken in our first game.} Ne7 {Breaking the pin and threatening 16...Ng4
 I can't say for sure with what I know, but I think that this is where
Martin starts to go wrong.  As Joann will exchange and destroy his K side
pawn structure.} 16. Bxf6 gxf6 17. Nh4 {The idea behind this move is to
allow Qd1-h4 where mate is threatened.} Rg8 {But, this prevents the threat
because if Joann is to play 18.Qd1, Martin will quickplay 18...Rg4, not
only preventing mate but attacking the N.  That's especially since Joann
wouldn't be able to capture with his Be6.} 18. Qc2 {So, she threatens this
way, instead.} f5 {And, Martin stops the threat, again.} 19. g3 {To prevent
any nonsense with something like 19...f4, followed by, 20...Bh3, Joann
opens up a window for her monarch.} Qf8 {I'm not sure why Martin played
this, but I believe that he's aiming for a K side assault with his Q since
I saw a similar pattern against bhidragon right after my blunder.} 20.
Ne2 {Planning something with her N, but I don't what the exact plan is.
 I just know that it's something since I learned about how powerful the
N can become with TA.  That was, in the N visualization count.} b6 {Trying
to create more mobility for his R because of what Martin will play later.}
21. Qc3 {Creating more mobility for her Bb1.} Qg7 {The general idea is
to have the Q in front of the R which is why Martin played this.} 22. b4
{Creating a solid pawn chain.  I likely would've attacked with 22.Bd3,
but I'm sure that 22...a5 would not be good for white.} a5 {And, Martin
still plays it, but this is better for white then using the B.  If they
exchange now, Joann will still have a useful pawn on b4, despite it not
being passed.} 23. Bd3 {Redeveloping her B.  And, this is where Martin
will get right into the action with the upcoming exchange.} axb4 24. axb4
Ra8 {I don't see the point behind this move since Martin isn't going to
attack the Q.  Of course, there's always more to chess then meets the eye.}
25. Ng2 {Bringing her N to a better square since it's off of the rim.}
Ra4 {Attacking b4 a second time.} 26. b5 {So, Joann protects this way,
but I would've done it with 26.Rb1.  However, this advances the pawn, and
Joann is probably counting on Martin to make a mistake.  If he's not careful
with c7, there is potential for b5 to become a passer.} Ra3 {This is why
Martin goes on the offense.} 27. Qd2 {I would've played answered with 27.Qc2
to keep eye on that pawn.  But, Joann has other ideas.} Rga8 {So, does
Martin which is why he doubles up with his R's.  Afterall, both R's are,
potentially, dangerous, on the same file.} 28. Nef4 {Joann has Martin's
Q in mind because what she'll play on her next move.} Ng6 {To prevent that,
Martin tries to exchange.} 29. Nh5 {But, it didn't work.} Qh6 {Martin answers
by counterattacking, and Joann is not afraid because of next move since
she doesn't retreat.} 30. Be2 Qf8 {This game is very complex.  I'd be thinking
that white wants to do damage with her Nh5, so I'd answer with 30...Be7.
 But, there's another threat, of some sort, that I'm just not seeing. 
Of course, the less I know, the better it is for me since I need something
this difficult for the mental exercise.} 31. Rb1 {But, Joann's got her
eyes back on b5.} R8a4 {I'm not sure why Martin played this.  I thought
that his aim was to be able to attack with 32...Bb4, but he's not going
to play that.} 32. Rec1 {I'm also not sure of what Joann wants here since
c7, and Bd6 are both protected.} Ra2 {This makes much more sense as it's
what I also would've played.} 33. Qd1 Qa8 {As now, we have 3 major pieces
in action.  As white, I'd be wondering about what to do now and would feel
that I'm in trouble.} 34. Bd3 {I believe that Joann was hoping that Martin
would do something with his f5 pawn, which would enable her to exchange
his Ng6.} R4a3 {I don't see the point behind this move since the Bd3 is
protected.} 35. h4 {I'm also not sure why Joann played this.  But, my guess
is that she intends to do something with her h pawn.  I've seen similar
examples of that happening.  And, when it looks like a pawn that isn't
passed doesn't do much, they later turn out to be a monster. } Qa5 {Martin
is trying to win Joann's b5 pawn since he is threatening 36...Bd7.} 36.
Nf6 {And, Joann stops the threat.} Qa8 {Which is why Martin goes back.
 I believe that he's trying to figure out what else he can do with his
Q.} 37. Bc2 {It would appear that Joann wants to win the exchange, one
of the R's for her B.} Be7 {Which is why Martin attacks the Nf6.  And,
it makes sense because if earlier, white were to play Bb3, the Ra2 would
be trapped.  But, if you exchange now, Martin can get the N.} 38. Nh5 {Well,
Joann did not like that and for good reason since her N is more mobile
then one of her R's.  I made that mistake in my first loss against Fred,
before overlooking a basic checkmate.  It was, as to why, he didn't take
a more valuable piece first which was the R.  Fred told that it was because
his N had more mobility, and in a similar position, Ken emphasized the
same thing to me.  That was, before our training during one of my previous
annotations.} Rc3 {Trying to tie down her B, but Joann has an answer to
that with her next move.  And, it's also how I would also respond since
Martin is forced to exchange his more mobile R which favors white.  Not
only that, but black will lose a tempo, in the process.} 39. Bb3 Rxc1 40.
Rxc1 Ra7 41. Qf3 {And, that enables Joann to get her Q right into action.
 Even though no one has a won game, I strongly favor white's position,
at this point.} Ra3 {Martin probably feels the same way which is why he
goes right after B.} 42. Rb1 {Which is why Joann protects this way.} Bd6
{I'm not sure why Martin played this.  My guess is that his goal would
be to play ...Ne7, but that's not going to happen, any time soon.} 43.
Nf6 {As Joann swarms in, instead.  As now, she is threatening mate again
starting with 44.Qh5  In fact, once that happens, the only way to avoid
mate would be to give up the Q for N with 44...Qg8, with which, Martin
could resign right then and there.} Kg7 {So, Martin stops the threat right
and there.} 44. Nh5+ {But, Joann is letting Martin know that he's not out
of the woods here.} Kf8 45. Bc2 {I believe that Joann's still hoping that
Martin will do something with f5 pawn to allow the exchange.} Ra1 {But,
Martin won't budge, and pins, instead to force a R exchange.  That shows
just how dangerous her Rb1 was becoming.  But, I'm just not sure what exact
damage it was capable of, in this position.} 46. Kh2 {Joann knows that
she much exchange and played this to prevent her Bc2 from becoming pinned
afterwards.  I would've overlooked this and gone right into it with 46.Rxa1?!
 But, I would not be happy, after 46...Qxa1+ since after 47...Bd1, I'm
not only pinned but feel that black would have an edge.  As some of white's
mobility would be gone, and as haile1996 pointed out in one of my annotations,
mobility is extremely important in chess.} Rxb1 47. Bxb1 Qc8 {On the other
hand, I don't see the point behind this move.} 48. Bd3 {Bringing the B
to a better spot.} h6 {I'm not sure why Martin played this, but I believe
that it was to do something about Joann's h4 pawn.  As the idea is that
if the Nh5 moves, black can quick play ...h5, blocking the h4 pawn.  Something
like that came to a vote in a current consultation game from the opposite
end of the spectrum but on the same file.  We were white, and black's pawn
was already on h5.  So, we voted on h4 to stop the pawn from advancing.}
49. Kg1 {But, I don't see the point behind this move.  As there's no immediate
threat of checkmate, and I don't see a threat of loss of material for white,
either.} Ne7 {I'm also not sure why Martin played this, as the N appeared
better on g6.  As it seems that this would give it less mobility.} 50.
Ngf4 {But, I do, however, see the point here.  As Joann is hoping that
Martin would exchange his Bd6 since it's stronger then white's N.} c5 {But,
Martin doesn't budge.  As I would and what you really should do which I'm
guilty of not doing, is give things a lot of thought.  I hate to say it,
but it's part of doing the hard work in chess.  And, I can relate to why
black would play this since I once thought the same thing against Carl.
 Martin is hoping that Joann forgot the rule about when you capture en-pessant
which she will do anyway.  Keeping in mind that same rule, I not too long
ago, tried the same thing on my opponent.  I forgot which pawn, but I was
white and black had made his way to the 4 rank.  So, trying to distract
him in hopes that he'd forget, I brought another pawn right next to it
to the 4th rank.  And, when he took advantage of that rule, I was lost.
 I have a feeling that the same thing will happen when Joann makes that
en-pessant capture.  But, time will tell.} 51. bxc6 e.p. Qxc6 52. Nf6 {I
thought that Joann was threatening mate, in this position.  As my idea
here would be to allow 53.Qh5, where 54.Qxh6# would be mate.  The only
thing that I forgot, which she didn't, is that black would stop the threat
with 53...Ng8, so that would make it unsound.  And, it would not be that
much different from a cheapo tactic, I also hate to say.  As now, white
would be forced to exchange and lose whatever initiative she might have.
 The only reason behind me knowing it is the fact that Joann doesn't threaten
on h5.  Instead, she plays something that I believe will force a win pretty
soon starting with her next move.} Bc7 {I'm not sure why Martin plays this,
but considering where I'd stand, I don't think that he has a lot of good
moves left.  That is just my opinion since I don't understand too much
of what's going on now except for what Joann plays next.  But, there probably
is a lot more that's going on then meets the eye, as Ken once said.  And,
she will exchange her less active piece for black's more active one. }
53. Nxe6+ fxe6 54. Qh5 {And, now she has a threat with the Q.  I thought
that it was mate, and the worst part is that if 55.Qh6+, I would announce
checkmate as I once did with Master Nathan.  He told me to be very careful
before announcing it by making sure that it was actually mate, and I overlooked
one move that he made.  The same thing is true here since Martin would
have 55...Kf7.} e5 {With this move, I'm almost certain that Joann is clearly
winning now.  As I don't usually a move like this, otherwise.  As it appears
that he's going for a K side assault of some kind since he might want to
exchange pawns.  But, I think it's more likely that Martin's goal here
is to play 55...e4  I've seen examples of some like that happening.} 55.
Nh7+ {But, Joann stops whatever plans Martin might have.} Kg7 56. Bxf5
{Despite no immediate mate, I like this move a lot.  As Joann is bringing
in another piece into the attack.} e4 {Considering the pressure I'd feel,
I would try to alleviate it by exchanging with 56...Nxf5.  But, I figured
out that this would only make things worse since Martin didn't do that.
 But, I really like what Joann's about to do with a series of checks.}
57. Qg4+ Kf7 58. Qh5+ Kg7 59. Qg4+ Kf7 {But, even though we're no where
near that yet, as Michael pointed out, this is where I realize that Joann
has a win.  As Martin was trying to go for a draw by rep with the perpetual
checks.  In this position, I would've overlooked it and played 60.Qh5+,
and I'd like these checks so much that the same position would, more then
likely, repeat themselves 3 times which would enable the opponent to declare
the draw.} 60. h5 {Thus, as with the consultation game that I noted earlier,
I really like this move.} b5 {Still doing what he can for counterplay,
Martin pushes his passed pawn.  The idea is that Joann miscalculates which
would enable him to pull a swindle and win by promote.  This is what I,
more or less, did with anitam where I lost a won game.  I don't blame black
for trying the same thing.} 61. Bg6+ {Not surprisingly, Joann doesn't allow
sees what's going on and doesn't allow that.  So, she answers by forcing
a series of exchanges.} Nxg6 62. hxg6+ Qxg6 63. Qd7+ {And, she'll use different
checks, where Martin won't be able to try anything for a draw by rep. 
Not only that, but Joann will force another exchange.} Kg8 64. Qxc7 Qxh7
65. Qd8+ {And, Joann is not going to exchange her Q, as it's needed due
to Martin's passer.} Kg7 66. Qxd5 {Martin could've continue trying to promote
with his b5 pawn.  But, he realized that it won't work, and black also
acknowledged the fact that the position is lost for him in this unrated
game.  So, he resigned, as sooner or later, Joann would've won the b pawn
which is also what makes Martin's position hopeless here.}  1-0
