1. Nf3 {This game (unrated) was decided as a training game and was supposed
to be anotated for learning purpose. Thank you for the comments.} d6 2.
d4 Nf6 3. c4 {The game has turned into a queen gambit} g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5.
e4 {Strongly aiming at the center } O-O 6. Be2 Bg4 7. Be3 Nbd7 8. O-O Bxf3
{losing the bishop pair for an unecessary trade} 9. Bxf3 e5 10. d5 {settling
at the center} a6 11. b4 {Slowing black advance on the queenside} b6 12.
a4 {taking control of field} h5 {doubtfull move : it weakens the black
king} 13. Qd2 {White's developpement is completed (rooks are joined) -
bayonnet attack (queen and bishop against fianchetoed bishop)   Lasker's
7 points analysis : 1. immediate threats : none 2. material : equality
3. Center : white is stronger 4. Open files : none 5. Pawn structures :
both are ok 6. Safety of the king : the black king is weakened 7. General
organisation : the black rooks are not joined 7} Kh7 {uncommon move - doubtfull.}
14. Be2 {Preparing the attack. White plans to attack the kingside straight
away, now that the center is closed} Ng8 {to free the DSB } 15. f4 {Launching
a kingside attack. The risk is an attack of the white king by the DSB but
white estimates that it's ok } f5 {increasing the weakness of the king}
16. exf5 Rxf5 17. Ne4 {The knight has to be part of the attack - black
is in trouble} Ndf6 18. Ng5+ {Strong menace - black will lose material}
Rxg5 {Probably the best move (fork attack between queen and king if 18...
Kh8 or discovery chess if 18.... Kh6)} 19. fxg5 {7 points analysis : 1.
Immediate threats : the black knight on f6 (Black's DSB is menacing the
a1 rook but not immediately). 2. Material : advantage white 3. Center :
contested. 4. Open file : the f one - under white's control. 5. Pawn structures
: The white one isn't very good (unsupported pawn on g5) 6. safety of the
kings : the white one is weakened by the attack but the black one is worse
7. general organisation : all the pieces are protected - white has plenty
of material aiming at the black king. } Ng4 {Doubtfull move : the next
trade will be disastrous for black, for it'll destroy black's pawn structure
and the black king will be terribly weak.} 20. Bxg4 hxg4 {Now black is
in very serious trouble if white manages to send the queen or a rook on
h4} 21. Qf2 {Launching the final assault} e4 {Black's counterattack will
be to slow, moving the queen would have been better.} 22. Qh4+ {There is
probably a mate whithin the next 10 moves, whatever black does now.} Bh6
23. Rf7+ Kh8 24. Bd4+ {mate in 4  }  1-0
