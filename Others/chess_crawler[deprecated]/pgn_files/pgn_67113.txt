{Have you ever asked yourself at the end of the game - even after a win
- how it is that it came about?  What did I do wrong?  What did I do RIGHT?
 The winner of this game requested this annotation.  The loser had made
but one 'inaccuracy' according to the GK Engine. So how had the game tilted
so far in one side's favour as to compel resignation by the other?  Let
us see...} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ {An alternative to the far more common
3.d4 that is becoming very popular in recent years, even at the top levels
of the game.  World Champions, M Carlsen and G. Kasparov have both played
it several times.} Bd7 {There is nothing wrong with interposing a knight
at d7 or c6, but this just about forces White to exchange, or lose time.}
4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {Artificial-looking, but I do believe it is the better recapture.
 The knight will be developed more actively at c6.   So far, this position
has been reached in M. Carlsen vs Hi Nakamura on at least 3 occasions I
know of.  You can't get a better endorsement than that!} 5. O-O {Also popular
is 5.c4, taking control of d5.} Nc6 6. d4 {(!?) Instead, 6.c3 or 6.c4 are
far more often played.  This pawn thrust seems to revert to more classical
lines of the Open Sicilian.  I wonder what difference the absence of light-square
bishops will make?} cxd4 7. Nxd4 Nf6 {For all the world as if 3.Bb5ch never
happened!  } 8. Nc3 {The e-pawn requires protection, and this knight development
seems to be the 'thematic' method.  But in this position, 8.Re1 is far
more the popular move.   I'm not sure why... Might have to come back to
this.} g6 {Also to be considered was 8...e6.   Black is playing a kind
of Dragon Defence.  That seems to be a very reasonable approach, as the
absence of his king's bishop obviates any kind of Porcupine Attack from
White.} 9. f4 {According to the GK World Database, 9 different moves have
been tried here, only one of which (9.Re1) having a positive score.  But
all the numbers are small - statistically insignificant; in 11 games, 
9.Re1 has scored 5 wins, 6 draws and 2 losses.  White's pawn thrust is
even: 1 win, 1 draw, 1 loss.  Anyone's game.  The move at least LOOKS thematic.}
Bg7 10. Nxc6 {(?!) It is hard to understand White's reasoning here.  He
has a fairly aggressive set-up, but presumably found it hard to figure
upon a plan.  The game even up to here, the GK Engine's evaluation begins
to trend in Black's favour.  Preferable seems almost any move to keep the
knight on the board: 10.Nf3 or Nb3.} Qxc6 {The right recapture.  One might
be tempted to retake with the pawn, for a nice, solid structure.  But after
10...Qxc6, Black begins to place White's centre under considerable pressure....}
11. e5 {(?) ... and it cracks at once.  This is the move the GK engine
calls an 'inaccuracy'.  Preferable seems 11.Qf3 or maybe 11.Qd3.  From
here on the game definitely leans in Black's favour. } dxe5 12. fxe5 Nd7
{Two pieces attack e5; none defend.  Surely the e-pawn is lost, and with
it, White's centre.  } 13. Qd5 {(?!)  It is possible that White was taken
by some beguiling tactical features here: the immediate threat Qxf7ch,
and the possibility of a knight-fork on c7 after the exchange on d5.  Mirages:
they disappear like smoke in a move or two.  A much stronger bid for counter-play
called for the delayed development of the bishop: 13.Bf4! Nxe5 14.Re1 Qc5ch
15.Kh1 Nc6 16.Ne4 Qb6 17.Nd6ch Kf8 18.Ne4.  The displacement of Black's
King would be at least partial recompense for the lost pawn and vacant
centre.} Qxd5 {(?!) The obvious response, but the GK engine (rightly) prefers
13...Nxe5!, incidentally protecting f7, as well as winning the loose pawn
at once.  } 14. Nxd5 Rc8 {(?!) So 'obvious' as to be played almost by reflex.
 Yet Black could have picked up the loose pawn at once and covered c7 at
the same time: 14...Bxe5!} 15. c3 {(?) Assuming that the attacked c-pawn
'had' to be defended.  But White could still have drummed up some counter-play
here, at the same time freeing his Q-side: 15.Bg5! ... and now: [a] 15...Rxc2?
16.Rac1 (Bxe7!?) ... Rxc1 17.Rxc1 Nxe5 18.Rc7! 0-0! 19.Nxe7ch =; [b] 15...
e6! 16.Nf6ch Bxf6 17.exf6 Rxc2 18.Rac1 Rxc1 19.Rxc1 Kd8! - and although
Black retains the edge, White is still in the game.} Bxe5 {As the c7-square
is covered, and there is no fear of a knight-fork, Black might as well
have played the more 'natural' 15...Nxe5.  This would have placed the knight
on a very fine 'point of departure' for further adventures, the bishop
being already quite well placed on g7.  Possibly Black was concerned about
15...Nxe5 16.Bf4, but that might have been met by 16...e6 17.Rae1 Nd3!
 Further, 16.Bg5 would have been effectively met by 16...f6. } 16. Bh6
{Stymies Black's castling, though the bishop is otherwise out of play,
here.  Possibly 16.Be3 was worth considering.  At this point, the game
already has the appearance that Black is rather more than a pawn ahead.
 White is reliant on piece play, but has few targets to aim at, and practically
no strong points near the centre upon which to anchor his minor pieces.
 Black has a mobile K-side majority that ought alone to be the game-winner.}
e6 {(!?) I would possibly have preferred 16...f6! here, anchoring the bishop
at its outpost, providing the king with the f7-square, and threatening
to lock up the White bishop by ...g5.  After 16...f6 17.Rae1 ... Black
does best with 17...Kf7! as 17...g5? 18.Bg7 Rg8 19.Bxf6! and White escapes
... with an edge!} 17. Ne3 {Perhaps more testing - if no real improvement
- would have been 17.Rae1, with the idea 17...exd5 18.Bg7! Black's reply,
17...Rc5 18.Nf4 Ke7 would have retained Black his advantage, though.} Rg8
18. Ng4 {Permits Black to lock up the bishop on h6.  Instead 18.Bf4 would
have kept some freedom of action.  Too bad about the exchange of minor
pieces.  When behind, sometimes one must accept the exchange of pieces
to avoid incurring worse.} g5 {(!) A kidnap operation.  The bishop may
be redeemed, but only at a cost!   Black's advantage is quite substantial
now.  White almost completely bereft of resource.} 19. Rae1 Bd6 20. Rd1
Rc6 21. Rf3 {With the aim of doubling rooks?  Targets are elusive.  Instead,
White might have tried a jailbreak by 21.h4, but after 21...gxh4, just
about the only safe move for the White knight would be 22.Nf2.  Not very
encouraging.} f5 {That mass of Black pawns alone would be a game breaker.
 White has nothing with which to oppose it.} 22. Ne3 {No use is 22.Rd3
fxg4 23.Rxd6 Rxd6 24.Rxd6 Ke7 25.Rd4 Rg6 and Black wins the bishop.} Rg6
23. Bxg5 {Biting the bullet. 23.Rh3, Bc5 lost the knight instead.} Rxg5
24. c4 Ne5 25. Rf2 {Black's close-order march is leaving no opening for
White to attack.} Bc5 26. Re1 f4 {More material falls off.  One way or
another, here, Black wins at least the exchange.  White opts for what seems
to be the least expensive way.} 27. Rxf4 Nd3 28. Rff1 Nxe1 29. Rxe1 Re5
{Now a whole rook ahead, White eliminates Black's last remaining mobile
troops.  Though after 30.Kf2, objectively strongest would be ...Rc6-c7-f7ch,
I'd probably cut to the chase, and wipe out White's pieces at once: 30.Kf2
Rxe3  31.Rxe3 Bxe3ch 32.Kxe3 Rxc4.  With no play left, White resigned.
 In this game, White's prospects vanished with the disappearance of his
centre.  Reliant upon piece play, White could find no worthwhile targets
in the carefully solid position crafted by Black.  Once fully developed,
Black's game  developed the unstoppable crushing momentum of an avalanche.
 It all seems so ... inevitable.}  0-1
