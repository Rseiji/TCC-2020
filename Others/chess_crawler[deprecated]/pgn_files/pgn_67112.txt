1. e4 e6 {French defense.} 2. f4 {Labourdonnais variation of the French
defense.} h5 {Pd5 is the common response.  Flinging out this pawn doesn't
really help establish control of the center of the board, and black ultimately
loses the forward thrust h rook. } 3. g3 {White will come to regret moving
that pawn.} c6 4. Nf3 d5 5. e5 f6 6. d4 Qa5+ {While generally best not
to get the queen out early, a well deployed queen against a weak player
(less than 1200) can be effective.  Black's queen proves deadly.} 7. Nc3
fxe5 8. Nxe5 Bb4 9. Ng6 Rh6 10. Ne5 Nf6 11. a3 Bxc3+ 12. bxc3 {Interposing
the bishop instead I think would have preserved that pawn.} Qxc3+ 13. Bd2
{Now inter posing the bishop costs white the d pawn.} Qxd4 14. c3 {Here
is where that g pawn move 3. g3 hurts.  14. Bg2 instead would have defended
the rook.} Qe4+ 15. Qe2 Qxh1 16. O-O-O Qe4 17. Be3 Nbd7 18. g4 Nxe5 {Bad
move.  White takes the knight which attacks Nf6 while simultaneously exposing
the h rook to white's black bishop.} 19. fxe5 Nxg4 {Four points for the
pawn and bishop versus five for the rook.  } 20. Rd4 {White pushes the
black queen out of the center of the board--a good move.  The exposed rook
can wait.} Qh1 21. Bxh6 Qg1 {I think I would have snagged the bishop with
the pawn.  Taking it with the knight sacrifices Ph5 to the white queen.}
22. Rf4 {Bxg7 seems like a much better move.} Nxh6 {Now white must play
Qxh5+ and solidify his position.} 23. Kd2 g6 {Black deflects the threat
to the h pawn.} 24. Kd3 {No.  While Qf3 sacrifices h2, that might be worth
it.} c5 25. c4 d4 26. Bg2 {Black cannot play Qxh2 now because white responds
with Bc6+ and the black queen falls to QxQh2. } Qb1+ 27. Qc2 {All fair
trades favor black, up six points.} Qxc2+ 28. Kxc2 Ng4 29. h3 {The bishop
about to be forked is worth more than that pawn.} Ne3+ 30. Kb3 Nxg2 31.
Rf6 Bd7 32. Rxg6 O-O-O {Nope.  Nf4.  Or Ne3.} 33. Rxg2 Rh8 {Rf8.  The f
file is open.} 34. h4 a5 35. a4 Kc7 36. Rg7 Rf8 {See?  Black wasted a move.}
37. Rg3 Rf5 38. Kc2 Bxa4+ {Nice.  Better than Rxe5 because that comes next.}
39. Kd3 Rxe5 40. Kd2 Bc6 41. Rg7+ Kd6 42. Rg8 a4 43. Rd8+ Kc7 44. Ra8 Re3
45. Rh8 Bf3 46. Rh7+ Kd6 47. Rxb7 {No.  That pawn was defended by black's
white bishop.} a3 {NO!  Bxb7!  Five points!} 48. Rb6+ Ke5 49. Ra6 Re2+
50. Kd1 a2 51. Ra3 Rb2+ {Nope.  Re3+ discovered.  White moves the king
and black takes white's rook for free.  Free rook.} 52. Kc1 Rh2 {I think
Rb1+ is better.  Black ends up trading pawn for rook.} 53. Ra6 d3 54. Ra5
d2+ 55. Kc2 d1=Q+ 56. Kc3 a1=Q+ 57. Rxa1 Qxa1+ 58. Kd3 Qd1+ {Nope.  Qd4#.}
59. Ke3 Qe2#  0-1
