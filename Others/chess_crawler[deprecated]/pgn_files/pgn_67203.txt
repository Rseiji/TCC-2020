1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 {Caro-Kann} 3. exd5 {exchange variation} cxd5 4. Nf3
Bf5 {and here we are already out of book. More common is Bd3} 5. Bd3 Bxd3
6. Qxd3 a6 {preventing counter play} 7. O-O e6 8. a3 {?!} Bd6 9. Re1 Nd7
{Nd7 to connect Ngf6 Knights and not worry too much on Bg5} 10. Be3 Ne7
{And here I seen Nf5 being better.} 11. Nbd2 h6 {prophylaxis! Castling
would lead Ng5 and Black could respond with either g6 or Ng6 and White
has the initiative. } 12. Nb3 Rc8 {controlling c4 square.} 13. Rac1 b5
{!} 14. c3 O-O 15. Qd2 {And here White develops an attack. The Caro-Kann
is defense and much of the moves require a defense against White's attack.
So much how you play is responding to White's moves. This differs greatly
with the Sicilian defenses...} Ng6 {! Nf5 would work to I believe. If White
continues Bxh6...gxh6; Qxh6 and Black has Bf4 fork tactic  .} 16. Rc2 Nb6
{eyeing Knightc4 square.} 17. Ne5 Bxe5 18. dxe5 Nc4 19. Qd4 Ngxe5 {And
here I thought it was best to capture pawn first while I can.  Capturing
the bishop empowers his rook to a good rank and can swing over to g3 or
h3} 20. Nd2 {Time clock for White: 1hr 22min.} Nxe3 {! Intermezzo! Black's
time: 57 min 34 secs.} 21. Rxe3 {And here I thought for a while... Black
has several candidate moves and they have their on purposes.  Ng6 retreating
back; Nd7 doesn't accomplish much; Nc4 can lead to exchanges with my own
rook lift to Rc4; Nc6} Nc6 22. Qg4 {It was here I notice that Queen Rank
4 has limited squares. Queen can only go to f4! Obviously, White is setting
up Rg3 threating checkmate. Only one move away and Black has to Respond
to White's idea.  } f5 {This is why I like Nc6 over Ng6. Nc4 would lead
to exchanges but I liked his rook c2 being inactive and not doing to much.}
23. Qe2 {?? If Queen-f4...g5?! let me know what you think maybe queenf6
better than pawn moves... Here I saw Qe2 as a mistake. White's Rook-c2
is hanging and I see a fork!  Do you see it?} Nd4 {!! Knight fork and sacrifice
and protects e6 temporarily. } 24. cxd4 {If Queen-h5...NxRc2; Rxe6 with
my knight sort of out of play and White's Rook is in... Queen-f6 holding
the position. } Rxc2 25. Rxe6 {White's time: 1hr 1min} Qa5 {Time: 43 min
5 sec. } 26. Rg6 Qxd2 27. Qe6+ Kh7 28. Rxg7+ Kxg7 29. Qe7+ Rf7 30. Qe5+
Kh7 {White resigns.}  0-1
