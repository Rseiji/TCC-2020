1. d4 {London system basic development move. } Nf6 {He develops the knight
avoiding e4.} 2. Bf4 {London system basic development move, raising the
pressure on e5.} d5 {The fight for the center goes on.} 3. e3 {London system
basic development move: now I make way to develop my light-squared bishop
later.} Nc6 {Development move.} 4. Nf3 {London system basic development
move.} g6 {He prepares to fianchetto: there will be no trade of bishops
on g3 most like.} 5. Ne5 {I start to provoke some action on the center.
I want to trade knights and gain that dark diagonal for my bishop.} Nxe5
{He accepted. } 6. Bxe5 {There it goes. Now that knight suffers some sort
of a pin.} Bg7 {He defended. } 7. c4 {Time to attack d5 pawn: I might develop
my light-squared bishop in case he trades, either way my queen gain another
diagonal and the knight can now move to c3 behind the pawn chain. } c6
{He holds his center.} 8. Nc3 {I bring the other knight to the action.}
O-O {His king is well sheltered now.} 9. Be2 {I develop the last minor
piece and prepare to castle. } Bf5 {He develops his light-squared bishop
as well.} 10. O-O Qb6 {He tries to explore the weak pawn on b2 which is
one of the drawbacks of London system due to the early advance of the queen's
Bishop.} 11. Qb3 {Fire agaisnt fire: if he accepts the exchange, I grant
my Rook a semi-open file.} Qxb3 {And he accepts. } 12. axb3 {There is my
rook free to go and an extra protection for c4 pawn, that compensates for
the doubled pawns.} a6 {He frees his Rook here since the a6 Pawn is now
protected by b7.} 13. Bxf6 {Well, here is the turning point: too many pawn
chains on the board slow the bishops and I thought the f6 Knight could
trouble me if it landed on e4, so it seemed worth it to give up the bishop
pair.} Bxf6 14. Na4 {Now I'll try to make use of the mobility of my knight
among those pawn islands.} b5 {A dangerous advance in my analysis, because
now you have to defend an extra pawn.} 15. cxb5 axb5 {I'm not sure this
was the best line, but above all I meant to keep the initiative and, with
a little luck, maybe weaken his pawn formation and create an open-file.}
16. Nc5 {I'm planning to maneuver my knight to take that strong light-squared
bishop, at the same time I propose the exchange of rooks.} e5 {He wants
a rupture in the center, and the dark-squared bishop makes him very strong
in that diagonal. } 17. Nb7 {I want d6.} exd4 18. exd4 Rfe8 19. Rxa8 {I
defended my bishop pinning the rook. } Rxa8 20. Nd6 {After an almost forced
exchange of rooks, I finally land my knight on d6 as planned. } Bxd4 {I
gave up that isolated pawn in order to eliminate the powerful defender
of the king and to damage the pawn formation. } 21. Nxf5 gxf5 22. Rc1 {Now
I offer a doubled pawn for a centralized, well placed pawn on d6.} b4 {I
see no point in this move.} 23. Rxc6 Ra1+ 24. Bf1 Bxb2 25. g3 {Wanna free
my bishop. } d4 26. Kg2 Kg7 27. Be2 {Now I wonder if Bd3 wouldn't have
been better. } f6 {Not sure what he wanted here too.} 28. Kf3 {Now I want
to put my king in the game: the intention is to block the enemy king and
maybe capture on f5.} Kg6 29. Rc8 {Now I want to limit his king's space.}
Ra3 30. Rg8+ Kh6 31. Bc4 {The bishop now is the last man standing against
those dangerous pawns, and since the king is cut off I can march on f5.}
Bc1 {He defends.} 32. Rd8 Bb2 33. Ke2 Ra1 34. Kd3 {Now I go for a different
idea: I leave my king as a bait on d3, inviting his rook to d1, this way
I would be able to double attack with king on c2.} Kh5 35. Rh8 {He didn't
fall for it, so I keep the pressure on the king and threat h7 pawn.} h6
36. Rg8 Re1 {And here I miss a checkmate with bf7. It was too late when
I saw it.} 37. Kc2 {Anyway, he would have to defend his bishop if he wanted
to keep his position. } Bc3 38. Bf7# {Done.}  1-0
