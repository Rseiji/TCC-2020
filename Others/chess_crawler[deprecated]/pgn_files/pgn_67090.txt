1. e4 {We were playing on board 2} c6 {He plays the Caro Kann as usual.}
2. d4 {Main line} d5 {Also the usual move.} 3. e5 {The advanced variation}
Bf5 {Bishop comes out. } 4. h4 {With a threat of 5. g4} h5 {So he stops
that.} 5. c4 {The usual move.} e6 {He prepares to develop his Bf8} 6. Nc3
{Standard development.} Nd7 {This threw me a little. I was hoping to follow
Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa vs Teja S Ravi Isle of Man Masters (2018), Douglas

b4 28.Qa6 Kd6 29.Rxb4 Rd8 30.Rb1 d4 31.Rc1 Kc7 32.Qxa7+1-0, but now I had
to start thinking for myself.} 7. Bg5 {As played in the above game, although
then on move 9 rather than 7.} f6 {This was a surprise, I wasn't really
expecting this move. It looks a little loosening on the black king position,
although I found out later that it had been played before.} 8. exf6 {so
I took, leaving his pawn on e6 backward.} gxf6 {This was also a surprise
to me, although I later found out it is the usual move in this position.}
9. Be3 {And my bishop drops back, protecting d4 } Bd6 {As in Bryzgalin,
Kirill (2446) vs. Driamin, Dmitrij (2323)} 10. Be2 {Attacking h5} Bg6 {Protecting
h5} 11. Nh3 {Planning Nf4 attacking h5 again. All this happened in Bryzgalin,
Kirill (2446) vs. Driamin, Dmitrij (2323). That game continued dxc4 12.
Bxc4	Bf7 13.	Qb3	Qb6 14.	Bxe6	Qxb3 15.	Bxb3	Bxb3 16.	axb3	Ne7 17.	Bf4 and
white has won a pawn although black went on to win.} Qb8 {But instead Nathanael
prevents my knight going to f4} 12. g3 {So I threaten it again.} Ne7 {he
develops.} 13. cxd5 {I exchange.} cxd5 {He takes back} 14. Nf4 {And I finally
play this! } Bxf4 {He takes } 15. Bxf4 {I take back} e5 {Considered best
by Fritz} 16. dxe5 {Fritz prefers Be3.} fxe5 {He takes back.} 17. Bg5 {with
some thoughts of exchanging on e7 } d4 {Black advances again.} 18. Bxe7
{Fritz also likes Nb5} Kxe7 {He takes back.} 19. Nd5+ {I throw in a check.}
Kf8 {Best according to Fritz.} 20. O-O {Compare the pawn cover of the respective
kings!} Qd6 {Fritz likes this move.} 21. Bc4 {Fritz prefers 21. Bf3. I
thought that was unplayable because of e5-e4, but white then has 22. Qxd4
attacking the rook on h8} b5 {Fritz prefers Kg7} 22. Bb3 {the natural retreat
but Fritz prefers f4 immediately} Nc5 {Fritz is still preferring Kg7, although
this looks strong.} 23. f4 {Threat 24. f4xe5+ winning the queen.} Kg7 {He
finally plays it!} 24. f5 {This is the first move considered by Fritz,
but Fritz later goes for fxe5 or Rc1} Nxb3 {He takes.} 25. axb3 {Fritz
prefers taking back with the queen.} Qxd5 {He takes.} 26. fxg6 {I take.}
a5 {Played to stop Ra6+. Fritz prefers e4 or Rh6} 27. Rc1 {I, playing white,
offered a draw here, which was declined.} e4 {Fritz prefers Ra7} 28. Rc7+
{Fritz prefers 28. Rf7+ Kxg6 29. Rf-c7 with a large advantage to white.}
Kxg6 {This seems to be a mistake. Kg8 is safer.} 29. Qc1 {White now has
a massive advantage according to Fritz.} e3 {To stop my queen coming in
on g5. 29....Rf8 was needed according to Fritz. White now has several wins.
The quickest is 30. Qc2+ d3 31. Qc3 with unstoppable mate threats on f6
and g7. 30. Rc6+ or Rc5 both win too. Howver unfirtunately I chickened
out with } 30. Qc6+ Qxc6 31. Rxc6+ Kg7 32. Rc7+ Kg6 33. Rc6+ {Draw agreed.
