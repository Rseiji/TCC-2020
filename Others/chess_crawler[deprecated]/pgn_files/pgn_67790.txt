1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {I see this variation frequently and I try to make the
bishop a target.} e6 3. Nc3 {He prevents d5 for the moment.} Ne7 4. a3
{When white makes this move it usually means he intends to withdraw the
bishop to a2.  Which does not put too much pressure on black but can still
focus on d5.  The move  4. e5 can keep the bishop on c4 after 4. e5,  Ng3
 5. Nf3, d5  6. exd6 e.p.  } d5 5. exd5 exd5 6. Ba2 Be6 {If black gets
the chance he will play Ng6 and develop the dark squared bishop at e2.
Here the on e6 the bishop supports the d5 pawn.} 7. d3 h6 {This is perhaps
premature but in some games in the past Bg5 has been annoying and there
is no great disparity in development.} 8. Nge2 {While Nf3 is the 'natural'
move. The Nge2 has the purpose of going to f4 and ripping the bishop then
playing Qh5ch! So this is where the craziness starts. ( Ng6 would have
been more natural - probably better. )} g5 9. O-O Bg7 10. f4 {White is
looking to break open the kingside.} f6 {However if white exchanges on
g5 the h file is opened so black gets some play.  The potential check on
h5 can be covered by Bf7, so black is thinking of castling queenside trying
to storm the white king.} 11. Na4 {White threatens the pawn on c5 and may
force black to live in the center.} Qd6 {Playing b6 would seem to mean
black will never castle and here the queen has h2 in its sights ( and it
does pay off! ). } 12. b4 b6 {OK so black ends up playing b6 anyway.  Nd2
was an option, castling queenside would not be an option now and the exchange
will let black hang on to the center.} 13. bxc5 bxc5 14. fxg5 hxg5 {Releasing
the tension also gives black a shot at h2.  } 15. Ng3 {Looking at the position
now I think f5 would have some real attacking possibilities ( unfortunately
it drops the pawn on g5 ), but I wanted to complete my development.} Nbc6
16. Be3 {Again threatening the c5 pawn and the only move is d4} d4 17.
Bxe6 {I don't think white was expecting the next move, My first thought
was to recapture but then again maybe the e3 pawn could be dangerous.}
dxe3 {Black is just a mess, but there are some possibilities. I had the
feeling that black was about to be crushed,  If you see a win for white
please let me know what I've missed because I can't find it.} 18. Bf5 Nd4
19. c3 {Black misses a tactical shot here.  N(4)xf5 wins the bishop since
the knight on g3 can't recapture as Qxh2 is mate! I wish I were better
at seeing the tactics quickly in a blitz game but experience is the best
teacher.} e2 20. Nxe2 Qxh2+ {Now white's king is in trouble too.} 21. Kf2
{I wanted to spend lots of time on Qh4 ch. But in a 3 min + 10 sec game
with about a minute left I thought I could win the knight on a4 by exchanging
on e2 and if the queen takes, checking on f4 forking the king and knight
on a4. But Qc3 would prevent that.} Nxe2 22. Kxe2 Qxg2+ {White takes with
the king.  Though I think he could have recaptuerd with the queen.  } 23.
Rf2 Qg3 24. Nxc5 {Black missed the win of a piece here ( I think ) 24.
Qe5 ch and White can save either the bishop or knight by going to e4. 
} Nxf5 25. Qa4+ {White starts to chase the black king now.  I'm short on
time and try to get into the kingside pawns for shelter.} Kf7 26. Qd7+
Kg6 27. Raf1 {White is trying to win and he doesn't play the perpetual
by taking with the queen on f5 and then driving the black king between
f7 and g6.  } Rhe8+ 28. Kd2 {If Kd1 then N3 forking the king and rook.
the rook now prevents the perpetual and ...} Qe3+ 29. Kc2 Qxc5 {Black is
now a piece up.  I am expecting Rxf5 and followed with Black playing Qe7
and I think I can weather the storm. But} 30. Qxf5+ Qxf5 31. Rxf5 {The
two pawns are dangerous and the black bishop is not a big help so maybe
white can still compete.} Rab8 32. d4 Re2+ 33. Kd3 Rbb2 {I thought having
the rooks behind the pawns would be best.  I am not sure I was right -
I would appreciate some advice here.} 34. d5 Rbd2+ 35. Kc4 Re4+ {This pushes
his king forward but makes the c pawn vulnerable} 36. Kc5 Rc2 37. R5f3
{This is the rook that had to protect since otherwise on 37. R1f3, Rc3ch
38. Rxc3 Kxf5!} f5 {Black frees his bishop and hits the c3 pawn.  Black
can push f4 if white doesn't take. But that might be better for white}
38. Rxf5 Rxc3+ 39. Kd6 {Now its time to get in front of the pawn } Rc8
40. Kd7 Ree8 41. Rf7 {Black gains a little time here,} Red8+ 42. Ke6 Re8+
43. Kd6 Red8+ 44. Ke6 Re8+ 45. Kd7 Rf8 {Black will be willing to trade
his bishop for the d pawn at the right time he just wants to get the rooks
off the board.} 46. Rxf8 Rxf8 47. Re1 Rf7+ {Protects the a7 and lets the
bishop get to f1. Black disconnected here.   I hope you enjoyed the game
and any comments would be appreciated.}  0-1
