{This is a little miniature of how important is the development and how
some moves that lead to a loss of time can be punished in a very severe
way.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {Vienna game. I don't dislike this move in a open
game since it can lead to several interesting line such as a delayed King's
gambit after 2. ... Nc6 or the Frankenstein-Dracula variation after 2.
... Nf6 3. Bc4 or also is a safe way to reach the Four Knights game and
eventually the Halloween gambit.} c6 {First non-development move. Since
Nc3 controls d5 perhaps Black wanted to increase the control on that square,
preparing the d5 push. But 2. ... Nf6 controls too d5 and develops a piece.
Also the d5 push cannot be performed soon since after 3. Nf3 Qc7 (defending
e5 pawn) 4. d4! and Black cannot do the counter move 4. ... d5! So, 2.
... c6?! is a dubious move.} 3. Nf3 {Develops the King's Knight and attacks
e5.} d6 {Defends pawn in e5, now we have a chance to traspose into the
Hanham.} 4. d4 {Now White occupies the center. If Black exchanges the pawn,
White can capture with the Queen that cannot be pushed away.} h6 {Why?
This is the kind of move a player should never do. White menaces two times
the e5 pawn, Black defends it only one time. So the result of this move
is to lose a pawn. Here Black should have played 4. ... Nd7, getting back
into the Hanham variation of Philidor defense which is a solid rather passive
line.} 5. dxe5 Bg4 {If 5. ... dxe5 6. Qxd8+ Kxd8 7. Nxe5. The loss of a
pawn is unavoidable.} 6. exd6 Bxf3 {So, what was the purpose of that Bishop
move? Black moved two times his bishop to exchange it with the White's
knight which was moved just a time.} 7. Qxf3 Qxd6 {A reason not to take
the Queen in play too early is that can be easily attacked by opponent
pieces. Better was 7. ... Bxd6.} 8. Bf4 Qb4 {Probably threatening Qxb2.
This kind of threat can often be ignored since a pawn can be gained at
the cost of too much Queen moves.} 9. O-O-O {White defends b2 and develops!}
Nd7 {Let's take a look to this position. White is a pawn up, controls the
center, castled queenside, developed three pieces in good squares (the
Queen is well placed since can partecipate to the attack). Black is a pawn
down, doesn't control the center, the King is in center (but ready to eventually
castle queenside), has his queen bad placed and developed the Queen's knight
on d7. Here the advantadge is big and White should not lose time!} 10.
Rxd7 {White now sacrifices the exchange in order to complete development
and get a great attack.} Kxd7 11. Bb5 {Again! White should take all pieces
in game, if 11. ... cxb5 12. Rd1+ Ke8 13. Nd5! pointing to c7. The b5 square
was the best one how to place the light square bishop since it increases
the pressure on the a4-e8 diagonal. Be2 was not effective.} Be7 12. Rd1+
{The hunt continues.} Ke8 13. Nd5 {Two pieces threated by the pawn on c6
and no one can be really taken (the Knight due to the pin, the Bishop since
the Queen is threated by the Nd5 and after 13. ... Qxb5 there is 14. Nc7+!)}
Qa5 14. Nc7+ {Starting a nice maneuver that results in gaining the g7 pawn
and then starting the final attack.} Kf8 15. Ne6+ Ke8 {The Ne6 is taboo
since if 15. ... fxe6 simply 16. Bc7+ gaining the Queen.} 16. Nxg7+ {Now
material is even again, but it really doesn't matter.} Kf8 17. Ne6+ Ke8
18. Nc7+ Kf8 19. Bc4 {The threat is clear. White is ready to attack f7.}
Rd8 {The game is lost anyway. After 19. ... Nf6 20. e5 Nd5 21. Nxd5 cxd5
22. e6!} 20. Rxd8+ Bxd8 21. Bd6+ {Black resigns. Any move will lead to
22. Qxf7#.}  1-0
