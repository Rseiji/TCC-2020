1. e4 {I have recently changed to 1.e4 after not playing it for some time
- trying out a new repertoire as white.} e6 {My opponent varies from the
Sicilian played in our first game by playing the French.} 2. d4 d5 3. exd5
{The French Exchange! But being played for a win by punishing Black if
he plays over-ambitiously &amp; trying to pose problems not necessarily seen
in other lines. (Postscript: my opponent admits he dislikes playing against
the Exchange variation, as do a lot of French players!)} exd5 4. Nf3 Nc6
{A perfectly respectable line - Black intends to play Bd6 &amp; Nge7 before
castling with a very solid position.} 5. Bb5 {This is the best move, better
than 5.Bd3, which can be met by 5...Bg4 with an annoying pin.} Bd6 {As
expected - an alternative for Black is 5...a6, inviting White to give up
the bishop pair in exchange for a slightly damaged pawn structure.} 6.
c4 {This move is a logical follow up to 5.Bb5, &amp; initiates an almost forced
variation leading to a very unusual pawn structure.} dxc4 7. d5 a6 8. Ba4
b5 9. dxc6 bxa4 {And this is it! Black has an extra pawn, although this
is likely to be temporary, as the a4 pawn can be captured at any time,
 but his queenside pawn formation is completely shattered. White's pawn
on c6 is a thorn in Black's side, &amp; a lot of the subsequent play revolves
around whether Black can capture this pawn easily, or if it remains on
the board.} 10. O-O Ne7 11. Nbd2 {Before capturing the a4 pawn, White develops
another piece &amp; attacks another of Black's weak pawns.} Be6 {Black decides
to defend the pawn, &amp; maybe has ideas of playing Bd5 to attack the pawn
on c6.} 12. Qxa4 c3 {This I think is a good move, looking to rid himself
of the weak c4 pawn &amp;, if takes, somewhat damaging White's  queenside pawn
structure.} 13. Ne4 O-O {Here, I expected my opponent to capture on b2,
but he decides to complete his development at the cost of a pawn.} 14.
Nxc3 {This move has the added bonus of keeping an eye on the d5 square,
so that Black cannot play Bd5 to attack the c6 pawn.} Qb8 {With the intention
of playing Qb6 to round up the c6 pawn, &amp; applying annoying pressure down
the b file, making it difficult to develop the dark-squared bishop.} 15.
Nd4 {White decides to defend the c6 pawn &amp; attacks the bishop on e6 at
the same time} Nd5 {Removing one of the attackers of c6, White didn't wish
to allow Nxc3 or Nb6, so decides to exchange pieces.} 16. Nxd5 Bxd5 17.
Nf5 {It was around this point that I started to look at a plan of eliminating
Black's dark-squared bishop, &amp; then move the Queen along the 4th rank to
attack Black's King with the dark-squared Bishop finally coming into play,
maybe on h6. Black's Queen &amp; Rooks are a bit out of play on the bank rank
&amp; queenside, &amp; it will take time to come to the King's assistance.} Qb6
{Black is still distracted trying to round up the c6 pawn, but I am happy
to leave it to it's fate in return for a kingside attack.} 18. Qg4 {With
an obvious mate threat. However, it is a surprisingly difficult threat
to meet. 18... Be5 loses to 19.Ne7+ followed by 20. Nxd5, which only leaves
18...g6. I originally thought this was the decisive mistake played by Black,
but it is the only chance for him to put up any kind of resistance.} g6
19. Nxd6 {Eliminating the dark-squared bishop now that I have initiated
dark squared weaknesses around Black's King. } cxd6 20. Bh6 {The dark-squared
Bishop enters the game with devastating effect. } Rfe8 21. Qg5 {The final
move of the game. White threatens to bring his Queen to f6 with mate on
g7, whilst also attacking the Bishop on d5. 21...Qd4 fails to 22. Rad1
22...Qxb2 23. Qxd5. }  1-0
