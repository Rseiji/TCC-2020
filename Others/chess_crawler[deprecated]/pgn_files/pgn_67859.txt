1. e4 {I started this game with a bit of trepidation. We were out-graded
on all boards including this one. However we managed to win the match 2.5-1.5}
c5 {It was played on the Lichess site. His ID there is EastCoker, mine
is CharlesHiggie} 2. Nf3 {This of course is the Sicilian Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence}
d6 {This is the main line.} 3. d4 {He opts for the Open Variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence#Open_Sicilian:_2.Nf3_and_3.d4}
cxd4 {I take} 4. Nxd4 {He takes back.} Nf6 {I attack e4} 5. Nc3 {He defends
it.} Nc6 {I play the main line - also called the Classical} 6. Bg5 {He
plays the Richterâ€“Rauzer Attack. The move 6.Bg5 was Kurt Richter's invention,
threatening to double Black's pawns after Bxf6 and forestalling the Dragon
by rendering 6...g6 unplayable.} e6 {For the time being I prevent the doubling
of my pawns.} 7. Qd2 {After 6...e6, Vsevolod Rauzer introduced the modern
plan of Qd2 and 0-0-0 in the 1930s. White's pressure on the d6-pawn often
compels Black to respond to Bxf6 with ...gxf6, rather than recapturing
with a piece (e.g. the queen on d8) that also has to defend the d-pawn.
This weakens Black's kingside pawn structure, but in return Black gains
the two bishops and a central pawn majority.} a6 {The usual reply, preventing
white from playing a piece to b5 and preparing b7-b5} 8. O-O-O {As Vsevolod
Rauzer recommended. } Bd7 {I have to protect Nc6 before advancing the b
pawn.} 9. f4 {The usual prelude to a king-side attack by white.} b5 {I
have to react fast on the queen-side. } 10. Bxf6 {The usual move, giving
up the two bishops but in return weakening black's pawn structure. Black
cannot take back with the queen because of  Qxf6 11. e5 dxe5 12. Ndxb5!
with a huge advantage to white.} gxf6 {So I take back with the pawn.} 11.
Nxc6 {He takes here.} Bxc6 {I take back.} 12. Kb1 {He puts his king to
a safer square.} Qb6 {I get my queen out.} 13. f5 {The usual central thrust.}
Qc5 {But his last move leaves his e5 square weak, so I prepare to occupy
it with my queen.} 14. Bd3 {His bishop comes out.} O-O-O {With my weakened
king-side I decided to castle queen-side.} 15. Rhf1 {He threatens to take
on e6 and then on f6} Be7 {So I protect f6} 16. Qf2 {This is a really interesting
move. To exchange queens or not? With the queens off the board I can stop
worrying about my king position, but against that he may be able to exploit
my weak pawns in an ending. Fritz actually thinks black shouldn't exchange
queens and likes Bb7 here, with an edge to white, however.... } Qxf2 {I
took} 17. Rxf2 {And he naturally takes back.} Rdg8 {I intend to try and
force him to play g2-g3 and then I play h7-h5-h3 and exchange my isolated
h pawn. Fritz prefers Kd7.} 18. a4 {But he strikes on this side.} bxa4
{So I take.} 19. Bxa6+ {He takes back with check.} Kc7 {King up.} 20. Bc4
{He threatens to take on e6 twice.} Kd7 {So my king comes across to protect.}
21. g3 {This is rather kind of him - he does the move I was hoping to induce.}
h5 {So I go back to my plan. Fritz prefers Rb8 with equality.} 22. fxe6+
{Again, I was very happy that he had played this, straightening out my
pawns.} fxe6 {I take back.} 23. Nb5 {Bold sacrifice by him.} Bxe4 {Patzer
sees a pawn, patzer takes a pawn. Fritz here likes 24. Rxf6 and if 24....Bxf6
then 25. Rxd6+ followed by taking on e6 with check, and an advantage to
white in all variations, although black is still in the game. Instead fortunately
white makes an oversight. } 24. Nxd6 {He plays this.} Bxd6 {So I take.}
25. Rfd2 {This pin is going to win the piece back - but I had something
prepared. } Ke7 {Fritz says Kc7 is stronger. The reason for this will become
apparent later. It just seems natural to keep the king with the pawns,
but as we shall see, this should have been a fatal mistake.} 26. Rxd6 {He
takes.} Bd5 {But I have this move.} 27. Ra6 {He tries this.} Bxc4 {I take
his bishop. Fritz prefers Ra8.} 28. Ra7+ {He throws in the check.} Ke8
{Of course not Kf8?? Rd8# Fritz now gives 29. Rd6 with the threat of Rb6
and Rb8 mate. Black can defend with Rg5 meeting 30. Rb6 with Rb5 but then
white exchanges rooks and plays 32. Ra8+ and picks up black's rook on h8
and wins. Thankfully he misses this. But if on move 25 I had played Kc7
instead of Ke7?? white would not have had this resource.} 29. Rdd7 {Thankfully
he plays this instead.} Bd5 {So I prevent Rd7-b7} 30. Rdc7 {He threatens
mate.} Kd8 {Easily parried} 31. c4 {He advances his past c pawn.} Be4+
{I throw in a check} 32. Ka2 {His king comes up the board.} h4 {and I set
about activating my rooks.} 33. gxh4 {He takes.} Rxh4 {I take back.} 34.
Ka3 {His king attacks my pawn.} Rxh2 {I take his pawn. If he takes my pawn
I take his and then exchange a rook with Ra2+ and I have a won ending.}
35. c5 {So he does this instead.} Rg3+ {I throw in a check.} 36. Kb4 {King
advances} Rxb2+ {I take with check} 37. Ka5 {King up again.} a3 {The problem
is this pawn is now a monster} 38. Rf7 {He threatens Rf8 mate.} Rg8 {I
defend} 39. Rfd7+ {He checks} Kc8 {king across again.} 40. c6 {Pawn advances}
a2 {and so does mine - and he can't stop this, so white resigned. Many
thanks for reading about this rather lucky win. Please leave a comment
or two and rate the annotation on the star system so that I know how I
am doing. Until next time dear reader!}  0-1
