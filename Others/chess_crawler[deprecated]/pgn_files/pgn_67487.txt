[Result "1-0"]

{This was an interesting game between former world champion GM Veselin
Topalov and a very young, who I believe is in GM Susan Polgar's spice program
for her training.  But, I think that Topalov made one oversight that lost.
 As with my last annotation, Susan showed this game to her viewers because
of how much to learn.  So, what happened here?   } 1. e4 {I wasn't sure
what to expect, but as with me, this Praggnanandhaa's, best by test.} e6
{I wasn't sure what we'd see from Topalov.  But, after the French, I know
what's coming.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 {As this is the Steintz's which
Susan implied that this is the most common variation in one of her first
lectures that I studied.  And, it favors white to the solid pawn chain
and gain of a tempo.} Nfd7 5. f4 {I don't know why Praggnanandhaa played
this, but I would've continued with 5.Nf3.} c5 {Offering to exchange pawns
which would favor Topalov.} 6. Nf3 {And, that's why Praggnanandhaa refuses
to do it.} Be7 {Having said that, Topalov continues with his development.}
7. Be3 {As does Praggnanandhaa.} b6 {I would've castled right then and
there, but I like this move, very nearly, as well and would've taken it
into consideration.  What I like about fianchetto's is what others like
about it to.  I feel more comfortable when a B is on a long diagonal. 
Now, it's a question of when a single fianchetto doesn't work out, besides
of a checkmate threat, lose of material, or gain of material.  Besides
those times, I wonder when it's ill advised to do this since because of
why I generally don't do double fianchetto's being the loss of tempo which
Ken emphasized in the KID.  But, I know that, in some cases, the same could
be said for just a single fianchetto.} 8. Qd2 {I would've pinned here with
8.Bc5, but there has to be something valuable on the Q side that I'm just
not seeing.} Nc6 {Continuing with his development.} 9. Be2 {Completing
his development, and unlike my earlier comment, this is also what I would've
played.} O-O {Topalov takes advantage of his opportunity to castle.} 10.
O-O {As does Praggnanandhaa.  But, we now get into a series of exchanges.
 } cxd4 11. Nxd4 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 Nb8 {Allowing his Bc8 to be developed. 
But, I wouldn't have played it, regardless since I, personally, don't like
the idea of undeveloping my N.  So, then the question becomes what Topalov's
LSB is, potentially, capable of doing.} 13. Bf2 Ba6 {This is the real reason.
 Topalov realizes that he can't do much with his B, and therefore, is ready
to exchange.} 14. Bxa6 {Having said that, I would've refused to exchange
here.  Instead, I would've played 14.Rfe1 or 14.Rae1 as an extra protector.
 And, then, if black were to exchange, I'd feel happier, as I'd be planning
to double with my Rooks, starting with something like 15.Re2, followed
by a later Re1.  So, with that, I know that there's something with that
variation that won't work.  I just don't what it is.} Nxa6 15. f5 {The
idea is to break through, as GM Goryachkina did with GM WU in the last
long game, before it was quick blitz which WU won.  But, it won't work
here since Topalov exchanges pawns here.} exf5 16. Nxd5 Nb4 {Bringing his
N to a better and is prepared to exchange white's Nd5.  Of course, Praggnanandhaa.}
17. c4 Rc8 {That's why Topalov goes after the pawn, but Praggananandhaa
has a ready answer with his next move.} 18. a3 Nc6 19. Rfe1 {Centralizing
his R.} Bc5 {Preparing to exchange the Bf2, as I would.} 20. b4 {On the
other hand, 20.Ne3 is the only move that I would've considered here.  As
I would not feel comfortable exchanging B's, which Topalov will now be
forced to do here.} Bxf2+ 21. Qxf2 Qd7 {Connecting his R's.} 22. Qh4 {Although
materialwise, it's even, I think that Praggnanandhaa, at the very least,
has a small advantage.  With this move, his Q is swarming in and is ready
to do damage, as was the case with my game against bhidragon.} Qd8 {Trying
to stop it.} 23. Nf6+ {But, Praggnanandhaa comes in, anyway.} gxf6 24.
Rad1 {Since he has the Q in mind, anyhow.} Nxe5 {But, I think that this
is the losing move.  I, on the other hand, would've played 24...Qe7, as
Praggnanandhaa, at the very least, is about to win the Q for R.  And, that
will enable to pick up another pawn, afterwards.} 25. Rxd8 Rfxd8 26. Qxf6
Ng6 27. h4 {I wouldn't know what to do here.  And, as such, this is also
what I also would've played to try and shut black's N out.} h5 {Topalov
is just as determined to prevent that.} 28. Rf1 {Attacking f5 again, which
forces Topalov's next move.} f4 29. g4 {That's why he plays this.  As such,
I would've responded with 29...fxg3 e.p.,  But, from this, I realize that
an en-pessant capture won't do Topalov any good because of his next move.}
Rd3 {Which is why he plays this, and Praggnanandhaa is now prepared to
take here.} 30. gxh5 Rg3+ {Trying to prevent further loss of material.
 } 31. Kf2 {But, Praggnanandhaa is telling Topalov that it's too little
too late.} Nxh4 {To prevent white's next move, I would've played 31...Nh8
which doesn't stop 32.Qxf4  I'm sure that white saw it, and with it, white
would do something much worse then what black had seen if that were played.
 I'm just not sure what he'd do.} 32. Qxh4 Rxc4 33. Re1 {Being a piece
down, combined with this move, Topalov resigns.  I see why, as it's more
then just what appears.  As it turns out, this move gives Praggnanandhaa
a mate in 2 or 3.  The only way to stop this would be by giving up his
f4 pawn+Rg3.  Combined with what you have, he'll be too far behind to continue.}
