{Annotated on request/ by invitation.  A Gameknot member asked me to have
a look at this game for points of interest.  Playe in a recent Children's
Hospital Foundation Charity Tournament somewhere in the USA, this features
a symmetrical opening in which Black 'copies' White for several moves,
until White invites Black to break the symmetry with an obvious developing
move.  The players preserve the balance for some time afterward, until
a series of errors tips the balance one way, never to be recovered.} 1.
b3 b6 2. Bb2 Bb7 {This is to be a 'Nimzo-Larsen' Attack, Symmetrical Variation'.
 This has been played in the top flights of grandmaster chess.  I never
touch the thing, myself... :-D} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O O-O
{Neither side is putting any pressure at all on the other, presumably waiting
for the game to develop further before undertaking any positive action.}
7. d3 d6 {As White hasn't played 7.d4, I might have chosen 7...d5, had
I been playing the Black pieces.} 8. e4 e5 9. c4 c5 {Locking up the centre.
 I don't like this overmuch, as once the action begins, White will have
the first chance to get his licks in.  The less strategic scope there is
the more likely (I believe) that Black will be thrown onto the defensive.
 If White's winning prospects happen to be slender, how much skinnier would
Black's be?  } 10. a4 a5 {Locking up the whole Q-side.  Henceforth, all
the action will happen on the K-side.} 11. Na3 {A deliberate invitation
to Black to break the symmetry.  Of course Black is not going to play 11...Na6,
is he?} Nc6 {He doesn't.  } 12. Nb5 {Logical enough, but targets are wanting.
 } Na7 {I don't believe I would ever have played this move in this type
of position.  But what to play instead?  It turns out 12...Nd4? is very
dangerous, as after 13.Nfxd4 neither recapture is safe: 13...cxd4 14.Ba3!
 and 13...exd4 14.e5!  The only move I can think of, 12...Ne8, at least
goes towards the thematic pawn break by ...f5, and also aims to exchanging
the KING's knight for White's intruder after ...Nc7 at some point.  If
White were to respond (to 12...Ne8) by 13.Ne1, then 13...Nd4 becomes playable.}
13. Nxa7 Rxa7 14. Nd2 {Preparing f2-f4, perhaps?} Bc8 {It may be dangerous
for Black to abandon the central light squares, something of a weakness
in his position, just as the dark squares are in White's.  To free the
a7-Rook, maybe 14...Ba8 was the better option.  Alternatively, Black could
have tried for K-side operations by 14...Ne8, with ...f5 to follow.  Even
so, somehow, one already forms the impression that the initiative is gradually
passing to Black.} 15. Bf3 {Played, presumably, to prevent a Black minor
piece landing on g4.  Of course, White won't want to weaken his K-side
by 15.h3,  if he can help it.  But it so happens that White's 14th move
opened up a whole different possibility: to do something with the light
squares at b5 or d5.  So the odd-looking 15.Nb1 Ne8 16.Nc3 ... came into
consideration.  Were Black then to play 16...Nc7, White should withhold
the further knight move to d5 or b5, in favour of further development:
17.Qe2, followed by 18.Re1 or 18.f4.  Black's Q-side would be sufficiently
tangled to encourage White to try for K-side operations.} Bh3 {Of course...}
16. Re1 {Probably preferable would have been 16.Bg2, when Black finds that
he hasn't really gained a tempo for ...Bg4 or ...Be6 (neither of which
offer much), and therefore should probably exchange light-square bishops.}
h5 {Black is showing signs of aggression.  There was also something to
be said for 16...Ne8 followed by 17...f5, though.  One has the distinct
feeling that Black is starting to set the pace.} 17. Bg2 Bg4 {A move earlier,
it would have been preferable to exchange; now this move is called for.
 The only difference in the posituion is the rook on e1 and the pawn on
h5.} 18. f3 {The obvious response, to drive away the bishop.  But it might
have been preferable to have subjected himself to the pin by 18.Nf3, however
counter-intuitively.  The problem is that after the g4-bishop moves, then
what?} Be6 19. Nf1 {Heading for e3?  White (whether he knew it or not)
 would very like to play f3-f4, and probably ought to have done.  But then,
instead of the likely-looking 19...Bg4, Black might well have struck at
White's weakened K-side by 19...h4! with attacking chances.} Nh7 {(?!)
Much more in Black's interest was to launch into an attack right off: 19...h4!
 White certainly would not have played 20.gxh4? Nh5! 21.Ng3 Nf4 or, possibly,
...Qxh4.  Black is much more soundly placed for K-side operations.  But
after this knight's retreat, White might be able to 'equalise'.} 20. Ne3
{(!) It was either this centralising move, or 20.f4, to take the fight
to Black.} f5 {Instead, 20...h4 still came into consideration.  However,
White is now reasonably well placed to contest Black's initiative.} 21.
exf5 Bxf5 {I would probably have played 21...gxf4 here, but there isn't
much in the choice.  A judgement call.} 22. Nxf5 Rxf5 {(?!) And here, I
think I really would have preferred to retake with the pawn.  I think a
mobile pawn roller  has more potential for attack in positions like this
than the half-open f-file.  At that, more might be had from the half-open
g-file.} 23. Bh3 {And here is another reason for preferring 22...gxf5.
 This bishop move is a real nuisance for Black, and might well have turned
the initiative over to White.} Rf8 {Where else?  If 23...Rf6, then 24.Bc1,
with the latent threat of Bg5 goes to tying up Black's K-side pieces. 
Surprisingly, 23...Rf7 might actually be playable: 24.Be6 Ng5! 25.Bxf7ch
Rxf7 26.Re3 Bh6, and suddenly Black's pieces have become very active. 
Whether there is anything more than a draw for Black in this line is hard
to say.  Indications are that White can throw back the exchange for a level
game.} 24. Re4 {(?) This turns out to be one unlucky rook.  Already this
move is a mistake that ought finally to tip the balance in Black's favour.
 Much stronger would have been 24.Be6ch Kh8 25.Rf1.  The bishop would have
been quite safe on e6, having the fine strongpoint d5 to retire into when
threatened.  Probably White 'saw' Be6ch, but figured there was no follow-up.
 But on e6 or d5, the bishop would have been a real bone in Black's throat.
   } Qf6 {(?) Plausible looking - attacking f3 - but in fact a blunder
that could have cost Black the edge White presented him.  Instead 24...Ng5!
forking rook and bishop, would have won Black the exchange.} 25. Re3 Ng5
{A move too late, but still fairly strong.  Black might equally well have
considered 25...Bh6.  Sometimes a given position can yield more than one
good move.} 26. Bg2 Raf7 {Attractive, isn't it?  Yet it might not have
been Black's best option at this moment.  White was (is) actually threatening
27.f4! and the only good way to deal with that threat seems to be to hoik
the queen off the f-file: 26...Qd8.} 27. Qe2 {(!?) It is true that 27.f4
was not playable (27...Qf5! 28.Qe2 exf4 29.Bxg7 Kxg7  30.Rf1 Qg4 after
which further exchanges lead to an ending favourable to Black: 31.Qxg4
hxg4 32.gxf4 Rxf4 33.Rxf4 Rxf4 34.Re8 Nf3ch etc).  But White might have
tried 27.h4! to drive off the knight.} Ne6 {Freeing the K-side pawns to
advance?  Eyeing d4?  This might have turned out unfavourably.  The Black
queen is in the way on f6, not only blocking the action of the doubled
rooks, but also that of the bishop in g7.  Better, then,. would have been
27...Qd8!} 28. Rf1 {Preparing f3-f4.  But now was the time for 28.f4! while
Black's e-pawn is pinned: 28.f4 Nd4 29.Bxd4 cxd4 (NOT 29...exd4 30.Re6!
with a big advantage for White) 30.Rf3 exf4 31.Rxf4 =.} Nd4 {Also possible
was 28...g5!?} 29. Bxd4 cxd4 {The right recapture.  Instead 29...exd4 was
simply unplayable owing to 30.Re6 Qf5 31.f4 Rf6 32.Bd5 ... and a winning
advantage for White.} 30. Re4 Bh6 {Obviously aiming for ...Be3ch, so...}
31. Rh4 {(?) The threat (...Be3ch) had to be stopped, and the only way
was 31.f4! exf4 32.Re6 Qg5 33.Bd5 Kh7 34.Rxd6 Re7 35.Re6 ... and White
manages to preserve the balance.   So far, White has been footing it with
black, but now the balance begins to tilt in Black's favour.  } Be3+ {A
fine post for the bishop!  It might well be worth a whole rook, there.}
32. Kh1 Qg5 {This might not have been Black's best option, as White could
now have played 33.f4! opening up the White bishop's diagonal to exploit
the weak light squares in Black's game, just as Black has done the dark
squares in White's.  So better might have been ...Re7, or, to keep both
rooks on the f-file, Kg7, obviating any pin.} 33. Re4 {(?) A mistake. 
White had to play 33.f4 to stay in the game: 33.f4 Rxf4! 34.Rhxf4 exf4
35.Qf3 Qf5 36.Qe4 Qxe4 37.Bxe4 g5 38.Kg2 after which Black's extra pawn
is probably not enough in view of the 'bishops of opposite colour' and
White's better placed bishop.} Kg7 34. Bh3 Rf6 {(!?) Instead, 34...Qh6,
to free the pawns to advance might have been preferable.  White's bishop
can play to d7, now, and then reestablish itself via c6 to d5, a useful
spot for attack or defence, as required.} 35. Kg2 {In my view, a very risky
decision.  The bishop can still escape via d7 and c6, and probably ought
to have done at once.  Now that the bishop's retreat is cut off, Black
can perhaps think about cutting off its break-out option: 35...R8f7.} Qh6
{The difference between a good move and an indifferent one is often one
move.  Right idea, but overlooking an admittedly subtle point.  More accurate
would have been 35...R8f7! keeping the bishop off d7...} 36. Rh4 {(??)
A mistake that accelerates Black's attack.  Instead, 36.Bd7! would have
enabled White to establish the bishop, when required, on the light long
diagonal via c6 and anchored at d5 or e4.  Then defensive resources could
be spared for other vulnerable points.  Black could have prevented this
with 35...R8f7, forcing the bishop to use the c8-square, from which, with
a Black rook on the 7-rank, access to the long diagonal is denied.  This
is quite a subtle strategic point, but upon it the game turned. } g5 37.
Re4 g4 {Trapping the bishop, cut off from advance and retreat both.} 38.
fxg4 {Opening the floodgates.  There was little hope to be had from 38.Bxg4,
which lost a piece for two pawns in a passive position, but now there no
hope.} Rxf1 39. gxh5 {Resignation maybe?  It is now mate in one.} R1f2+
{(?) prolonging the agony.  Slightly stronger was 39.Rg1#.} 40. Kh1 Rxe2
{0-1.  From a symmetrical opening, the game appeared to be finely balanced
for about 20-25 moves.  A series of mistakes at moves 24 and 25 seemed
set to rock the boat, but neither side made the best use of the chances
then offered. Although Black appeared to be setting the pace for perhaps
the final 15 moves or so of the game, White was just about preserving the
balance and even threatened from time to time to wrest the initiative away
from Black.  It was the unfortunate manoeuverings of the rook on the 4-rank,
coupled with the bishop's losing the opportunity to break out from h3,
that finally tipped the balance Black's way.  After such prolonged tension,
perhaps it is no surprise that the denouement should be so catastrophic.}
