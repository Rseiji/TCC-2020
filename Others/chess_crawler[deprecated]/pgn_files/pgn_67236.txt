1. e3 {This is an unusual opening: doesn't claim any center, but does release
the queen and light square bishop.} d5 {Ok, I'll take some center.} 2.
d4 Bf5 {Pressure on c2 pawn, develop bishop outside pawn chain} 3. Bd3
e6 {support bishop (...Bxd3 4. Qxd3 activates white queen)} 4. Nf3 Bg6
5. c3 Nf6 {I'd like, perhaps to get the knight to e4.} 6. Bxg6 hxg6 {fxg6
works, too. My idea here is to use the fact that the rook is released and
possibly castle queenside later.} 7. Qb3 b6 {Nbd7 looks interesting to
trap (but not capture) white queen e.g. 7...Nbd7 8 Qxb7 Nb6 it fails to
9 a4 ... 10 a5, though} 8. Qb5+ Qd7 9. Qb3 Nc6 10. Ng5 Na5 11. Qc2 Be7
12. b4 Nc4 13. Na3 Nxa3 14. Bxa3 a5 {I can win the pinned pawn on b4 (my
dark square bishop is X-ray attacking his dark square bishop)} 15. bxa5
{Blunder.} Bxa3 16. Qb3 Rxa5 {Win the pawn, protect the bishop} 17. Nf3
Ne4 {Attack the pawn on c3. My idea is to try to trade queens on c3 or
c4 after ...Qc6 (I’m a piece up). I need to pay attention to my king safety
(no threats right now)} 18. Ne5 {This stops my Qc6 plan; can we trade on
b5?} Qb5 19. Qxb5+ Rxb5 {Ok, piece up endgame. c3 pawn is hanging. What
to do about possible c4?} 20. g4 Nxc3 21. Kd2 Ne4+ 22. Ke2 Bd6 {I don’t
mind trading pieces} 23. a4 Rb2+ {My original idea here was to snap up
the f-pawn after king moves to back rank} 24. Kf3 {Kd8,Ke8,Kf8 all lose
the f-pawn} Rxf2# {Now I get the pawn -and- checkmate}  0-1
