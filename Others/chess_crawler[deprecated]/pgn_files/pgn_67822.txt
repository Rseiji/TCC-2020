1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {The 3. d4 move makes this an 'Open Sicilian'
game, often characterised as giving rise to very complicated positions}
Nf6 {3. ..cxd4 is the more common continuation here, but Nf6 is an excellent
move} 4. dxc5 {4. Nc3 or 4. Bb5+ are both somewhat better here, at least
played more often. I would say that white loses a tempo of development}
Nxe4 {The best move} 5. cxd6 {Probably the best. Now the position is as
open as it could possibly be!} Nc6 {This is probably better than Nxd6,
as it favours development} 6. Bd3 {A sound developing move. Nbd2 and Be3
also being possible} Nxd6 {The best move. } 7. Nc3 {A logical development.
c3 and 0-0 were also possible. The position is quite even at this point,
which means that White has lost their natural beginner's advantage} e6
{Fianchettoing the BSB (black square bishop) with g6 here was probably
a better strategy here} 8. O-O Be7 {Logical moves} 9. Bf4 O-O 10. a3 Nf5
11. Ne4 h6 12. Qd2 Ncd4 {A good move, even though 12. ...g5! might have
been still better} 13. Nxd4 Qxd4 {This is more aggressive and much better
than Nxd4} 14. g4 {This is a blunder as it poses no significant threat
or gain but seriously weakens White's king position. 14. c3 was the simplest
continuation} Nh4 {This is a very good move that immediately takes advantage
of White's mistake} 15. Qe2 Qxb2 {This is 'greedy'. 15. ...f5! had been
the strongest continuation of the king side attack} 16. g5 {A very good
move in this position, although Bg3 was also alright} hxg5 {Bxg5 or g6
had been much better} 17. Bxg5 {This is a mistake. Nxg5 would have equalised
the position} Bxg5 18. Nxg5 g6 {Excellent move! Note that 18. ...Nf5 19.
Bxf5 exf5 20. Qh5! is winning for White} 19. Rfe1 {This is a blunder that
probably loses the game. Be4 had been a reasonable continuation} Qf6 {Precisely!
Now Black has a winning game. White loses their piece or Black checks with
Nf3.} 20. f4 {Not very much else possible} Qxf4 21. Nh3 Qf3 22. Rf1 {Ng5
had yielded less damage. Now the game is over in practise} Qxh3 23. Be4
e5 {f5 was a somewhat better possibiity} 24. Bd5 Bg4 25. Qxe5 Nf3+ {Very
nice game!}  0-1
