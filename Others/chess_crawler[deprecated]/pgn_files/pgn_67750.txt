{Possibly the best way to introduce this game is with the winner's p.m.
to me: Hello, archduke_piccolo, ... I have just come off one of my longest
games ever on GK where at one point I was considering offering a draw.
It turned out to be a convincing victory in the end with what I saw as
a forced mate confirmed by the GK engine afterwards. The player resigned.
If you have time, I would love it if you could annotate the game especially
with regards to how both sides positioned their various pieces towards
and including the end game. The end game is my biggest weakness in chess.
Having another set of eyes cast over this would be of huge help to me.
Kind Regards, Valifoor  So let us see what happened...} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3
Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {Scotch Game.  Not one of my favorites for either
side, as in my view it leads often to a dry sort of game.  This one turns
out to be rather more interesting.  Good gambit options, though a bit risky,
are 4.c3 or 4.Bc4. } Nf6 {A popular response, alongside 4...Bc5.  Also
possible are ...Bb4ch, ...Qf6 and ...Qh4.  I think I've played all these
at one time or another.} 5. Nxc6 {By far the most popular move here at
Master level.  At the cost of two tempi invested in this knight, White
gets to knock a few dents in Black's Q-side structure.} bxc6 {Recapturing
'towards the centre'.  Although ...dxc6 would keep the pawns compact and
allow quick development to the Queen's bishop, Black is probably not keen
on 5...dxc6 6.Qxd8ch Kxd8 7.f3, when White has the firmer grip on the centre.}
6. Bd3 {Much more often played is 6.e5.  Rather than respond at once with
6...Nd5, Black seems to do better by inserting 6...Qe7 7.Qe2, and then
...Nd5 8.c4 Nb6, cutting back White's options subsequently. } d5 {'Equalising'.
 This thrust seems best if Black wants to equalise in a dryish position.
 But 6...d6 has been played, permitting a slightly inferior position in
the hope of preserving dynamic chances.} 7. e5 {Instead, 7.exd5 just about
guaranteed Black a comfortable, drawish sort of game: a slightly weaker
structure balanced by a stronger central presence.  With this move, White
also makes a small concession to inject a little dynamism if the game.
 But from this point on, the GK engine indicates that Black has a niggling
edge (varying between 0.51 and 0.99) that persists for much of the middle
game.} Ng4 {And here's why.  Black will win the e-pawn.  Let's see how.}
8. Qe2 {Castling is more usual here, the e-pawn being inviolate on account
of the pin: 8.0-0 Nxe5?? 9.Re1.  But against castling, 8...Bc5 is a fine
response.  The text, however, has been tried at Master level...} Bc5 {This
move is so obvious and strong, nothing else comes into consideration. 
Attacks f2.} 9. O-O Qe7 10. Nc3 {Giving up the e-pawn at once.  In this
position White has more often protected the e-pawn for longer: 10.Bf4 g5
11.Bd2 Nxe5 12.Re1 ... when Black can opt for any of 12...Nxd3, 12...Bd6,
12...f6.  The insertion of 10.Bf4 goes to inducing a K-side weakness in
Black's structure as at least partial recompense for the pawn lost.  Incidentally,
after 12...Nxd3 in this line, things could get pretty exciting after 13.Qxd3
Be6  14.b4 Bxb4 15.Rxe6! fxe6 16.Qd4 e5 17.Qxb4 Qxb4 18.Bxb4 ... when White
gets 2 minor pieces (and a somewhat passive position) for rook and 2 pawns.}
Nxe5 11. Bf4 f6 {Probably the most circumspect.  Black is a pawn ahead,
has a big presence in the centre, and plenty of prospects of improving
his position.  Playable instead is 11...Nxd3, but after 12.Qxd3, White's
lead in development and more active might go some way to offsetting Black's
advantages.  Black elects to keep his well placed knight, and has no objection
to an exchange on e5, presenting Black with a broad centre.} 12. Na4 {(?!)
I rather think this helps Black.  But it is getting quite hard to form
any kind of plan for White.  It's hard for the pieces alone to leverage
weaknesses in Black's game, and wedged between the respective pawn lines,
are apt to become targets.  White's more advanced mobilization counts for
little, here, I believe.  Maybe 12.Rae1 Bd6 13.Bg3 ... (to permit 14.f4)
13...g5, but Black still seems to have an edge.} Bg4 {Completing development
of the minor pieces - with a tempo, as the White f-pawn is pinned.  A nice
intermezzo, but Black could have played 12...Bd6 at once, leaving the 'off-side'
knight looking a little sheepish.} 13. Qe1 {(?!) A very strange choice,
given the availability of the d2-square.  But perhaps White wanted to keep
it open for his dark-square bishop.} Bb4 {Hard one to call, this.  I'd
prefer the consolidating 12...Bd6, aiming toward the K-side.  White could
have replied 14.Bd2, here...  Of course, c3 is not playable.} 14. Nc3 {(?!)
Submitting to a serious pin, though, as it turns out, Black can not exploit
it by 14...d4.  Was that what White was hoping for?  Let's see: 14...d4
15.Bxe5! ... and whether Black takes with the pawn or queen, White breaks
the pin and gets for his pieces some nice central squares (e.g.: 15...Qxe5
16.Qxe6 fxe5 17.Ne4...).  The pawn deficit would remain, of course, but
White would be better placed to resist. } Nxd3 {Forcing a weakness in White's
hitherto pristine pawn structure.  Black could equally well have castled,
or brought a rook to the b-file, here.  Of course, Black does right to
maintain the pin: 14...Bxc3? 15.Qxc3 ... and the attack on e5 and c6 ensures
the recovery of the lost pawn, and to White a fine game.} 15. Qxe7+ {The
queens have to come off anyway, though, at the cost of isolating one of
his pawns, White might have got a rook into play: 15.cxd3 Qxe1 16.Raxe1ch.}
Kxe7 {With the queens off and ownership of the centre, Black is quite unconcerned
about the 'loss' of castling rights.  The King is quite well placed in
the centre.} 16. cxd3 Kd7 17. d4 g5 {Pawns being used to drive White into
passivity.} 18. Bd2 Rab8 {Also playable was 18...Bf5, to bring the central
light squares even more under Black's control.  Black figures that the
e-file can wait...} 19. b3 {White could have played 19.a3 Bd6 20.b4 ...
to lock down the Q-side.  But that would have left his bishop with almost
no mobility at all.  The key to chess is mobility.  That is what gives
the queen its great power.  } Bf5 20. a3 {Now might have been a good time
to bid for the e-file (Rae1).} Bxc3 {Winning a second pawn.  But Black
has also ceded to White the potential drawing resource associated with
the 'bishops of opposite colour'.  We'll come back to this.} 21. Bxc3 Rxb3
{The situation does not look at all good for White - 2 pawns down, and
a 'bad' bishop (see where White's pawns are located), and the rooks still
on.  White's sole hope now lies in the potential drawing chances offered
by the 'bishops of opposite colour', but with the rooks still on, that
has to be a pretty distant hope.  The problem Black has, now, is that his
pawn majority is pretty much held under constraint by White's pawns, especially
aided by the bishop about to move to b4.  } 22. Bb4 Re8 {The game enters
a new phase - the 'presque-endgame' as I like to call it.  A game with
on both sides 3 pieces still on the board is not an end game in my view.
 But Black has to find a plan (and so does White for that matter, but his
plan will be predicated on how Black chooses to proceed).  A couple of
plans spring to mind.  One is to press forward on the K-side, hoping to
break up the pawns there, or at least to commit White to defending on that
wing.  Another is, after 22...Ra8, to advance on the Q-side (...a5), to
drive away the bishop, followed by ...Kd6 and ...c5.  Black's chief aim
for now should be to commit White's defences in one place, then switch
attention elsewhere - like a tennis player forcing his opponent to run
back and forth across the court.} 23. Rfe1 Re4 {A good place to offer the
exchange.  Black should as far as possible avoid rook exchanges - especially
the last pair of rooks - on any but his own terms.  The rook won't stay
there, of course, but it will induce a very slight weakening...} 24. Bc5
{Dual purpose: a fine move: protects the d-pawn and attacks the a-pawn.
 It also serves to close down - for the time being - Black's Q-side pawn
majority.  The downside is that this pretty much commits the bishop.} a5
{(!?)  I feel certain I would have played this pawn move myself, so useful
and strong the move is, further depriving the White bishop of squares.
 Even though the pawn is on a dark square, there is no way for White to
lever it off.  Having said that, the Gameknot engine calls this an inaccuracy,
in favour of 24...g4.  There is no doubt that ...g4 would be as good, to
inhibit the move that, in its omission, White is now permitted to play.}
25. f3 {(!) Driving the rook off the fine square, e4.  So what if Black
had played 24...g4?  Couldn't White simply have won the a-pawn?  Well,
it's not so simple as that: 24...g4 25.Bxa7 Rxa3! 26.Bc5! Rxa1 27.Rxa1
Re2 and Black retains his edge, still with one pair of rooks on.  So: back
to the game...} Rxe1+ {(!?) Makes sense, but in a position like this, I'd
be very conscious of the need to keep Black's options as wide open as I
could.  Hence my preference for 25...Re6, here.} 26. Rxe1 Rb1 {(??) In
my view a terrible misjudgement.  Black had at all costs, if he wanted
to preserve his winning chances, to keep his rook on the board.  In view
of the equalising threat of 27.Re7ch etc, Black had pretty much to play
26...Be6.} 27. Rxb1 Bxb1 28. g4 {(!) At once placing Black's K-side under
restraint.  In my view, the game now must be a forced draw, right here.
 White presently has the Q-side locked up secure.  Now if you look carefully,
you will see that so long as White keeps a pawn on g4 (whilst a Black pawn
remains on g5), it is absolutely impossible for the Black King to break
through on the K-side, either.  Maintaining that g4-pawn would be quite
easily achieved, even though Black has the light-square bishop.  Let's
see, then, how the thing panned out.} Ke8 29. Kf2 Bg6 30. Kg3 {The right
posting for the King.  He can protect the g-pawn indefinitely.} h6 {By
now the GK engine, correctly, was assessing this game as 'too close to
call'.} 31. f4 {Nothing wrong with this move, but, having found a drawing
plan already, I would have stuck to it and not played this move.  The reason
is that my plan is predicated on the presence of a Black pawn on g5.  It
doesn't matter that White can't break through either.  White's winning
chances are precisely squat.} gxf4+ 32. Kxf4 Kf7 33. h4 {Good - but not
the only.  Instead, 33.Ba7, going after the c-pawn, was a good dynamic
defence in this position.  This would commit the King to the defence of
the pawn as after, say, 33...Kg7 in response, White equalises with 34.Bc8
c5! 35.Bxc7 cxd4 (or 35...c4, 36.Bxa5=) 36.Bb6! d3 37.d3 Bxa5 =.  That
Ba7 move remains a leitmotif for the remainder of the game - and one that
leads to white's downfall.  Now, how did that happen...?} Bd3 34. Ba7 {Threatening,
as in the previous note...} Ke7 {Taking no chances.} 35. Bc5+ Kf7 36. Ba7
Ke7 37. Bc5+ Ke8 {Black was toying with offering the draw, but here keeps
his options open.  Now, although objectively speaking the position ought
to lead easily to a draw with best play (Black still can't force his King
through, or a passed pawn, on the K-side), there is no reason not to test
the defender's (White's) resolution and technique. So Black keeps playing.}
38. Ba7 Be4 {Now, at this point White could have shut down the entire width
of the board with 39.h5!, leaving Black with absolutely nothing to do.
 The only way the King can get White's side of the board is via the light
squares on the Q-side.  That would leave White with the option of tempo
moves with the bishop, or even getting in amongst Black's pawns stranded
on dark squares.} 39. Bb8 Kd8 40. Ba7 Ke7 41. Bb8 Kd8 42. Ba7 Bc2 {Again,
avoiding the threefold repetition.  Now, with 43.Bc5 Ke8 44.h5, White could
still force the draw.} 43. g5 {(?) A further concession by White.  He's
certainly skating close to the edge! 43.Bc5 or 43.h5 were indicated.} fxg5+
{(!)} 44. hxg5 h5 {(!)  Preserving winning chances, however slender.  They
are still dependent upon White's making further concessions.  White has
done well so far, even with less than optimum play, but it is that difference
that offers Black hopes to pull down the full point.} 45. Kg3 Kc8 46. Kh4
Bg6 {Now Black's bishop is committed to defending the K-side.  } 47. Bc5
Kd7 48. Ba7 Ke6 49. Bb8 {(?) This is certainly a mistake.  All White had
to do now was play Bc5 - Ba7 - Bc5 -Ba7 forever, switching only to Bf8
if and when the King attacked the a3-pawn, and there was nothing Black
could do.  So far this idea has been safe enough, as Black has been committed
to defending the c-pawn.  But now Black is not so committed. After this,
White is probably already lost.} c5 {(!) Breakout!  Black gets a second
passed pawn.   } 50. dxc5 {(??) Busted.  Already in serious strife, White
compounds his mistake and falls into a hopelessly lost ending.  He had
to continue as he began: 50.Bxc7.  Could he have held then?  Let's take
a look: 50.Bxc7 c4! (Instead 50...cxd4 seems good enough only to draw:
51.a4! Be8 52.Bxa5 Kf5 53.Bd2 and the blockade is complete [53...Bxa4 54.Kxh5])
 51.Bxa5 Kf5 52.a4 ... (to decoy the enemy bishop) 52...Be8 53.Bc3 Bxa4
54.Kxh5 Ke4 (material is now level, but...) 55.Kg6 ... (55.Kh6 loses faster)
55...Kd3 56.Ba1 c3 57.Kf6 Kxd4 58.g6 Bc2!  59.Ke6 Bb3! (59...Bxg6?? only
draws after 60.Bxc3ch) 60.g7 ... (Will he make it??) 60...Kc5! 61.Ke5 ...
(Nope.  61.g8=Q, d4ch skewers the newborn queen) 61...d4 62.Kf6 Bg8 63.Ke7
Kc4 and Black wins.  But at least in that line there were prospects for
White of offering resistance.} Kd7 {(!) Threatening a terrific bind on
the Q-side by ...Kc6, jailing the bishop, and leaving his passed pawns
to run free.  Hence White's reply.} 51. c6+ {(!) He had no choice, but
it took guts to play it all the same.} Kxc6 52. Ba7 Kb5 {The material situation
hasn't changed, by the dynamics have been transformed,  Black's Q-side
is free to run.} 53. Be3 c5 54. Kg3 d4 55. Bc1 {(?) Lost anyway, but the
bishop's best defence usually against a passed pair such as Black has,
is to keep the bishop on the pawns' diagonal.  So, 55.Bf2 was indicated.}
c4 56. Kf3 c3 57. Ke2 {Instead 57.Kf4 d3  58.Ke3 h4 59.Kf2 d2 is no improvement,
nor as 57.a4ch.} d3+ 58. Ke3 h4 59. Kf3 d2 60. Bxd2 cxd2 61. Ke2 {1-0 At
this point White resigned without waiting for Black to play 61...h3.  The
game features a sustained edge for Black that disappeared with the appearance
of the bishop and pawn end game.  In defence, White began to allow small
concessions that though not compromising the draw, yet gave Black hope
that the situation would change.  White played a counterattacking motif
once too often, choosing a moment at which it was no longer safe, and plunged
into a lost ending.  If you want to see strategy in action, it's hard to
go past this game.}  0-1
