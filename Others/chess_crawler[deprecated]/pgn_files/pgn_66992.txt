1. d4 {I was very pleased at beating someone with a higher ECF (English
Chess federation) grade than me, although afterwards I found out that I
did have a higher Elo rating (1947 compared to 1905)} d5 2. c4 {Queens
Gambit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit} e6 {Declined https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit_Declined}
3. Nc3 {The usual developing move.} Bb4 {One of the comments I read online
about this move is 'Theoretically there is nothing wrong with it. Practically,
you've limited your options as black. In the Nimzo-Indian it's not always
desirable to play d5 early in the opening, and in the QGD Bb4 is not really
a constructive move.' I agree. Black is never really threatening to double
white's pawns with Bxc3 as after bxc3, white can always undouble his c
pawns with c4xd5.} 4. Qa4+ {Another quote I have found 'Qa4+ forces black
to play ... Nc6, blocking the c-pawn from making the c7-c5 advance. Therein
lies white's advantage.' I am surprised that 4. Qa4+ is not the most popular
reply to 3...Bb4. } Nc6 {Forced.} 5. Nf3 {Now white continues developing.}
Nf6 {Black also. We have now transposed into the standard Ragozin Variation.
http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessopening?eco=D38} 6. Bg5 {White pins
the Nf6, as is common in many variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined
- less in this one however, with 6. e3 being a more popular move.} O-O
{Black castles.} 7. e3 {Logical development again.} h6 {Black attacks the
bishop.} 8. Bh4 {Bishop drops back.} Bd7 {Black now threatens Nxd4! with
a discovered attack on the Qa4 and if QxBb4 then Nc2+ forks king and queen.}
9. Qb3 {I can't find this move on any of my opening databases, in all of
them, white drops the queen back to c2 instead. However I have a threat....
On my opening databases, the position without 7....h6 and 8. Bh4 thrown
in, I have got a couple of games where the queen drops back to b3. White
won both of them. Fritz likes Qb3, giving white a small edge (+0.38). }
a6 {Black ignores my threat. Fritz prefers 9....g5 to prevent what follows.}
10. Bxf6 {Fritz likes this move, initially, but later switches to Rc1.}
Qxf6 {The obvious recapture.} 11. cxd5 {White takes. Fritz agrees.} exd5
{Black takes back.} 12. Qxd5 {White takes again, going a pawn up.} Be6
{Black attacks the queen. Fritz actually prefers Bf5 or Bg4} 13. Qh5 {Fritz
actually prefers 13. Qe4 initially, but then changes to 13. Qh5. Against
13. Qe4 I was afraid of Rfe8 and black is threatening discovered attacks
on the white queen, for instance Bxa2} Rfe8 {Black is threatening ....Nxd4
in some variations.} 14. Be2 {Again, Fritz thinks this best.} Rad8 {Black
mobilises his last piece. } 15. O-O {Again Fritz approves of castling.}
Bf5 16. Rfd1 {I like this move, with the threat of 17. Bd3 exchanging white
squared bishops. Fritz actually prefers other moves, such as Bc4, Rfc1
and a3.} Bxc3 {Black has a plan to prevent the exchange of white squared
bishops, but it involves giving up the two bishops. Fritz prefers Bg6 or
Bc2.} 17. bxc3 {White takes back. White's pawn centre is now strengthened.}
Be4 {With the idea of meeting 18. Bd3 with Rd5 19. Qg4 Bxf3 20. Qxf3 Qxf3
21. Rg5. } 18. Rac1 {Fritz prefers Nd2 immediately.} Rd5 {Black hits the
white queen.} 19. Qh4 {I 'threaten' the exchange of queens. Fritz prefers
Qg4.} g5 {Fritz prefers 19....Qg6} 20. Qg3 {Eyeing the pawn on c7.} Rf5
{Presumably hoping for 21. Qxc7 g4 and after my knight moves, he takes
on f2. I should have ignored this, as after 21. Qxc7 g4 I have 22. Qg3
pinning his g pawn and protecting f2.} 21. Nd2 {But this move is strong
too, threatening the exchange on e4 followed by Bd3 winning rook for bishop.
For the first time in the game, Fritz puts white's advantage at over 1
(+2.53). Funnily enough after Qxc7 Fritz puts white's advantage as +2.25,
so I am not sure why it prefers Qxc7.} Ra5 {Fritz agrees that this is the
best try.} 22. Bc4 {Fritz agrees that this is best.} Bf5 {Fritz prefers
Bg6.} 23. Qxc7 {So I take. Fritz approves!} Re7 {Played to stop the b pawn
falling too. Here 24. Qb6 looks good, threatening d5, but black has Be6!
diverting the Bc4, and if 25. Bxe6? Rb5! winning the white queen. 25. Bxe6?
is not forced, white has 25. Qb3 or 25. Ne4, but I thought 24. Qg3 was
clearer. Fritz agrees.} 24. Qg3 Bg6 {His bishop drops back, demonstrating
his mistake on move 22.} 25. Bb3 {With several possibilities, for instance
Bc2, c4 and Nc4.} h5 {I sensed an element of desperation about this move.
White has control of the centre, and black is attempting something on the
wings, but if white plays carefully, he should win, two pawns up without
any compensation. } 26. Qf3 {Fritz prefers Nc4, but I like this, centralising
the queen.} Rf5 {Black wisely avoids the exchange of queens.} 27. Qe2 {Now
the white queen is nicely placed in the centre, and the advance of the
e pawn is coming.} g4 {Continuing with the hopeful king's side advance.}
28. Bc2 {I hit the rook. Fritz prefers the immediate e4.} Rg5 {Fritz prefers
Rd5} 29. e4 {The long-awaited advance!} h4 {Black advances again.} 30.
e5 {White advances again. Fritz approves! White is not really threatening
the black queen, as e5xf6 allows Re7xe2, but white is gaining valuable
space in the centre. } Qg7 {The black queen drops back anyway.} 31. f4
{I thought this was good, if he takes the f file is open for my rooks,
and if he doesn't my pawn centre is overwhelming. Fritz prefers 31. Ne4.}
gxf3 e.p. {Fritz like this move.} 32. Nxf3 {and this one.} Bh5 {Black pins
the white knight. Fritz prefers either Bxc2 or Rg4.} 33. Qf2 {Fritz likes
this - breaking the pin and renewing the threat to the Rg5. It doesn't
actually win the exchange, but exchanging pieces helps me. } Bxf3 {So he
stops that - at the cost of his active bishop. Fritz likes this move.}
34. Qxf3 {White has to recapture of course.} Nd8 {I find this move strange.
Fritz prefers Qh6.} 35. Rd2 {Freeing up my queen for other duties. Fritz
prefers Rb1.} Re6 {Fritz prefers Ne6.} 36. Rb1 {With threats down the b
file, but Fritz is happier with Rf2 or Rf1.} Rh6 {Preparing to support
the h4-h3 advance, but Fritz prefers Qh6.} 37. Qd5 {This looked good to
me attacking Nd8, but Fritz prefers a4.} Ne6 {And here Fritz prefers Qf8
- it may be a better move, in the sense it prolongs the game more, but
with some passivity black would be doomed. The move played is the the best
practicable between two human players.  } 38. Rxb7 {But this goes. Fritz
approves.} h3 {Black finally gets in this pawn thrust. Fritz also applauds
this move. } 39. Rb8+ {White throws in this check. Fritz likes this too!}
Nf8 {Virtually forced. This knight is reduced to passivity.} 40. Be4 {Giving
extra support to g2. Fritz again looks at all sorts of moves - g3, a3,
Rc8, Bb3. } Rg4 {Fritz prefers hxg2. Perhaps black is preparing to sacrifice
on e4 in some lines?} 41. Qa8 {I thought this was good, tying the black
queen down to protecting f8, but Fritz likes 41. g3.} Rh8 {Black is getting
desperate! Fritz prefers hxg2 but still gives the position as plus 4.47
to white. } 42. Rdb2 {Fritz likes this move, preparing the final combination.}
Qh6 {Black is hoping to start checking on c1.} 43. Rxf8+ {I take, of course,
if Qxf8 then Rb8 wins the black queen.} Kg7 {So black tried this. OK stop
and find white's quickest win!} 44. Rxf7+ {Did you find it?} Kxf7 {Black
sportingly plays out to the mate.} 45. Rb7+ {Another check.} Ke6 {Forced!}
46. Qxa6# {And now mate. Many thanks for reading. Please rate this annotation
on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing
with my annotations. Until next time dear reader!}  1-0
