{jkarp: So, an opposing captain, goldentweety posted in the Team Captains
of Gameknot about a potential consultation game. He did this with a team,
and I'll tell you that vote, consultation, games are great for learning
which is why Joe wants to do this for his team. But, in order for this
to work out, there'd have to be enough participation. So, is anyone interested
in a vote game, if we get enough participation, at least 3 participants
but 4's better, I'll go ahead and start one up. And, it would be between
this team and his team.  petemellor: I'm up for it  roneshet: I would like
to take part in it  ptitroque: Ok for me.  jkarp: As an extra, I intend
to annotate the game when it finishes for archduke_piccolo's analysis as
there's a lot to learn from him. } 1. e4 {To make a long story short, all
but one player wanted this move.  So, this would be played, out of fairness.}
c5 {roneshet: e5 i say advance a little bit. Maybe to achieve a stronger
hold on the center of the board.  a_random_guy: 2.c3 There are a lot of
viable moves in this position, but I'll vote for the Alapin's variation.
 ptitroque: 2.c3 yes 2.e5 crates an advanced pawn, difficult to defend
and we move twice the same peice which is bad in the opening} 2. c3 Nf6
{a_random_guy:  3.e5 This is the main book move, anything else seems a
bit dubious.  bluenoser: e5 I was wondering about this move also? Isn't
the rule nnot to move the same piece in the opening?  This is a question
only, I like e5 as a move.  a_random_guy: blunoser True, there is a 'rule'
to not move the same piece in the opening. However...  1.Our e pawn is
attacked and is undefended right now, so we have to do something about
it  2.By advancing to e5, we force them to move their knight twice in the
opening!  roneshet: e5 I agree. The knight is going for a tour around the
court while we advance our pawn and release him from the threat at the
same time. } 3. e5 Nd5 {roneshet:  c4 lets advance our pawn on more step,
while they wonder around with their knight.  a_random_guy: 4.Nf3 Pushing
c4 now would give us a very weak d4 square later on, so I wouldn't recommend
it right away, even if i does kick their Knight away again. The two main
moves here are 4.d4 and 4.Nf3. I'll vote for the later, but I really don't
mind 4.d4 either.  bluenoser: 4.Nf3 I agree Nf3 protecting our e5 pawn
we have already pushed and making onother opening move.We will also gain
our tempo back by them already moving their knight twice.  roneshet: Bc4
Maybe we can consider moving the bishop. though, threatening the knight,
preparing for casteling and taking a good stand with the bishop.  ptitroque:
4. Nf3 Most natural move} 4. Nf3 Nc6 {a_random_guy: 5.Bc4 5.d5 is also
an option, but I'll vote for 5.Bc4, developping a piece and hitting their
knight. bluenoser: Bc4 I like this move as it is a good developing move,
and a step away from castling king side. I usually play the g3 then Bg2.
Nice to see something different played than my normal moves.  ptitroque:
5.Bc4 OK } 5. Bc4 Nb6 {a_random_guy: 6.Bb3 There isn't much to say here,
aside that we need to save the bishop somehow. 6.Bb3 keeps the bishop on
the strong a2-g8 diagonal, and we can retreat it to c2 if they push c4.
 roneshet: Bb5 advance a little bit. if they threaten our Bishop we can
change pieces with their knight, setting two pawns on the same column.
a tip from the Great list of tips of ptitroque. We also leave the diagonal...
which is a downside... What's better?  a_random_guy: @roneshet Don't forget
that we'd also give up the bishop pair for no valuable reason in that 6.Bb5
a6 7.Bxc6 line. Doubling pawns is good and all, but non-isolated doubled
pawns isn't that big of a weakness early on.  ptitroque: 6.Bb3 Seems OK
for me  bluenoser: 6.Bb5 I was looking at Bb5...if a6 we could play BXc6
taking N and doubling up their p's on c file. If they push d6, we can take
Nc6 doubling up p's.  ptitroque: 6.Bb3 -further analyse They'll probably
castle short (because of the advance of their c pawn), our bishop will
be pointed at their king.  Doubling pawn is a disadvantage but it would
create an half open file for their rook and 2 pawns on the c file would
reinforce their center, which would balance the inconvenient.} 6. Bb3 {ptitroque:

Bc2 I believe now Bc2 is forced.  a_random_guy: 7.Bc2 Yeah, 7.Bc2 is pretty
much forced there.  roneshet: Bc2 agreed agreed. the only move.  ptitroque:
7. Bc2 What else ?} 7. Bc2 Qc7 {a_random_guy: 8.Qe2 We gotta protect that
e pawn somehow...  (Well, we could play 8.O-O and sacrifice that pawn for
faster development, but it's not worth it in my opinion)  roneshet: d4
I say we sacrifice o paw, but ope up the way for the BB. Than castling.
I don't like the way the queen stands before the king. It's dangerous...
 a_random_guy: It's not that dangerous actually Their rooks are far away
from entering play, we'll have a lot of time to castle away to safety by
then.  ptitroque: What about 7. d4 ? If they take en passant (7...c4xd3
it's not bad for us, as we'll answer by : 8. Bxd3. We'll have developpement
advance, If they take our e pawn with their knight, we can set our DSB
on f4.  We'll get a very opened game but I believe that we'll be more mobile
than black.  bluenoser: 8.....d4 I think d4 looks good, we have lots of
time for castling and it appears they have a few moves before they are
able to castle. I like the open game that will follow for us.  ptitroque:
sorry, d4 is bad for if 1. d4 cxd3 e.p. 2. Bxd3 Nxe5 3. Qe2 Nxf3+ 4. Qxf3
 and we exchange the queens and are one pawn late. I believe a random guy
idea is better. I vote 8. Qe2  a_random_guy: @ptiroque 8.d4 cxd3 e.p. 9.Bxd3
Nxe5 10.Bf4?? Nxd3+ 0-1 } 8. d4 cxd3 e.p. {ptitroque: 9. Bxd3 For obvious
reasons  a_random_guy: What about 9.Qxd3? It's not like they can easily
attack our queen on d3, and we'd be clearing our back rank to get our rooks
out faster.  Sample line 9.Qxd3 Nxe5 10.Nxe5 Qxe5+ 11.Be3 (Any black move)
12.0-0.  roneshet: Honor the queen...Bxd3 I prefer not to take out the
queen at this stage of the game unless it's necessary...doing it almost
always caused me trouble... I'm in for Bxd3  bluenoser: Bxd3 Bxd3 looks
like a natural move. Like roneshet I don't like taking my Q out early,
obviously we do need to do something about that P at d3.} 9. Bxd3 Nxe5
{bluenoser: 9...Castle Again would this be a good time to castle?  a_random_guy:
9.0-0 We might as well, while we can.  9.0-0 yes} 10. O-O Nxd3 {ptitroque:
11.Qxd3 What else ?  bluenoser: 11. Qxd3 There are no other moves.  roneshet:
Only move... Qxd3 they only possible option} 11. Qxd3 e6 {ptitroque: 12.Be3
So that we can send our knight on d2. And we get some control on the center
and prevent them to play 12...Bc5  We're one pawn late and therefore have
to develop quickly.  12. b3 to prepare a further Bb2 seems also worth to
consider but the developpement might be slower.  roneshet: Be3 This is
my favourite move.  bluenoser: Nbd2 I like this move simply because it
is a developing move and centralizing our knight. I am not concerned of
about having the bishop locked in for one move. Be3 would be my second
option.} 12. Be3 Be7 {ptitroque: 13... Nd2 developping.  roneshet: agreed
Nd2. They are going to castle next move.  bluenoser: Nbd2 Nbd2 looks good.}
13. Nbd2 Nd5 {ptitroque: I propose 14. Re1 To protect our DSB, increase
our control on the center, set our rook on the 1/2 open file e. Maybe they
will play Nf4 to menace our queen, in which case we'll have to move our
queen but at least, they won't be able to send their knight on e2  a_random_guy:
14.Rfe1 Yeah, it seems reasonable.  Don't forget to indicate which piece
moves, if two of the same piece type can move to the same square...  roneshet:
Bd4 it is a good position for the bishop. they can't threaten him in the
next move. maybe Ne4 before/after so we can attack f6 square if needed.}
14. Rfe1 Nxe3 {ptitroque: 15. Re3 Seems better than taking with the queen,
because the rook has to be developed and we menace to bring its brother
on e1  a_random_guy: 15.Rxe3 I agree. We're down a straight pawn with not
a lot of compensation though.  bluenoser: Re3 15. Re3 looks like our best
move.  roneshet: agree Re3 i agree. this seems the best move} 15. Rxe3
O-O {ptitroque: 16. Ra e1 For obvious reasons  bluenoser: Rae1 I been looking
for something else and can't find anything. Looks like best move to me.
 roneshet: agreed i agree, though i would never have thought of that move...}
16. Rae1 a6 {ptitroque: Next move We've 2 options : 1. defend our queenside
by playing something like a4 or b4 2. Try to be the quickest on the kingside
(for ex. Nd5 and the Rh3 to menace mate or similar moves like Re5)  We
are one pawn late but we have some developement advance and (probably not
for long) we control the center.  bluenoser: 16.....b4 I like the b4 option!
 roneshet: kingside Nd4 I like the attack option.} 17. b4 b5 {roneshet:
Nd4 I think we should try to move the rocks to the king side.  bluenoser:
16. Nd4 Nd4 looks like a good move to me. 16.Ne4  Ne4 also looks like a
possible move?  ptitroque: 16. Nd4 I considered Ne5 to create a quick menace
on their king (Rh3) but it doesn't seem to hold if black plays f5. I prefer
Nd4 for it immediately frees the e3 rook for a further Rg3 or Rh3)} 18.
Nd4 {When this was played, I somehow, got the move number mixed up which
I admitted.  I said 16, but this was after the 17th move, just to avoid
confusion for commentators.} Bb7 {roneshet: Nf3 I say we should join another
knight to the battle  a_random_guy: 19.Rh3 I say we wait before moving
the knight by putting our rook in the best spot. They have to defend their
h7 pawn somehow.  ptitroque: 19. Rh3 We are in late in material, we have
to create quickly a threat to keep the initiative  bluenoser: Rh3? We now
have our rooks in the same half open file. Rh3 is easily countered by h6.
 What about Nd2b3, aiming for Na5 threatening the B?  ptitroque: @bluenoser
if h6 we play g4!?  bluenoser: IF we play g4 can't he simply take back
with his Q?  ptitroque: @bluenoser The queen is on a blck diagonal and
cannot hit g4  bluenoser: Sorry, I was looking at f4 not g4, my mistake.
 } 19. Rh3 f5 {roneshet: f3 Nf3, seems good enough to me.  a_random_guy:
Hmmm We're down a pawn, and we'd probably lose the long game, so that's
why I suggest the probably bad 20.g4?! to get an attack on their king as
soon as possible.  bluenoser: Nf3?... We have two knights that could go
to f3....which one were you thinking?  g4 looks bold and daring I like
it!  roneshet: Nd2f3 I mean the d2 knight  ptitroque: 20. g4 ?! For the
reasons explained above; Our only chance is to attack quickly} 20. g4 Qf4
{ptitroque: 21... f3 for obvious reasons  roneshet: forced We are forced
to do f3  ptitroque: @roneshet We are not absolutely forced to play f3,
we could elect to trade the queen.  bluenoser: 21...f3 appears f3 is forced.}
21. f3 Rae8 {roneshet: N4e2 I say we scare their queen away from that place/
It's dangerous having her there...  ptitroque: @roneshet if 22. Ne 22...
Qd6 we cannot afford to trade the queen.  So that our queen should come
to c2 - Is it good for us ?  roneshet:  fine by me I think it's fine tu
retreat our queen to c2. Their queen is very dangerour there.  bluenoser:
Qc2 Nd4e2 would chase their Q to d6 forcing us to exchange Q's or move
our Q. I think we want to keep our Q on the diagonal it is now on so AGREE
Qc2.  a_random_guy: What does 22.Qc2 accomplish in the first place? I'd
suggest 22.gxf4 to close up the f file as soon as possible instead, possibly
followed by 22...exf5 and 23.Re2.  This position is quite complicated...
 roneshet: N4e2 This is my move. not Qc2...Qc2 is a sequence move. Fxf4
seems good. although more risky...   bluenoser: 22....gxf4 I hadn't even
thought of this move. Worth considering I think.  ptitroque: 22... gxf4
considerably weakens our king and we'll have 2 isolated pawns.} 22. gxf5
exf5 {ptitroque: 23. Nf1 This knight is poorly place. If we can send it
on g3, we'll menace the f5 point.  bluenoser: 23...Nf1 Looks good to me...I
really didn't see it until you pointed it out. I know you are thinking
long range on this move.  a_random_guy: hmmm... 23.Re2? I'm not so sure
about 23.Nf1, as they can easily push g6 to protect their f5 pawn. Furthermore,
they could also play 23...Bc5!?, forcing some trades that would advantage
them (We can't recapture the bishop on c5 immediately, as our e1 rook would
be hanging. 23.Nf1 Bc5 24.bxc5 Rxe1 or 24.Rxe8 Bxd4+ 25.cxd4 Rxe8 and we're
still down a pawn with our pieces awkwardly placed.)  We do want to keep
our knight on d4 for as l;ong as possible, as it is well centralised and
black can't challenge it with a pawn.  Black might also want to play Bf6,
threatening to exchange our well placed knight. If we leave our d2 knight
on d2, we'll be able to play N2b3, covering our d4 knight in a pinch. Therefore,
we might not want to move our d2 knight yet.  With all that being said,
I'd suggest Re2, to place our rook on a protected square if they move their
dark-square bishop and to prepare Rg2, if needed.  (I corrected some errors
from my latest post.)} 23. Re2 {roneshet: Re2 Well, a bit late. But better
late than never...   I learned from your explanation... Thank you.} Bh4
{ptitroque: I consider 24. Nf1 to play a further Ng3 or Ne3 with menace
on f5  roneshet: Re8 If we Change rocks, they lose the defense on f5, and
we can take the pawn...  a_random_guy: 24.Rxe8 Followed by 24...Rxe8 25.Nxf5
Re1+ 26.Nf1 seems ok for us?  bluenoser: 24.RXe8 Looks good to me.  ptitroque:
OK} 24. Rxe8 Rxe8 {a_random_guy: 25.Nxf5 Hitting their bishop and clearing
the way to h7 in one fell swoop. 25...Re1+ isn't a huge problem for us
right now, since we can block it with 26.Nf1 and everything seems to hold.
 ptitroque: 25. Nxf5 agree. I considered 25. Qxf5, forcing a queen exchange
but I belive it's less interesting for us.  bluenoser: 25. Nxf5 Agree Nxf5...I
had also been looking at Qxf5...but he could play QxNd2?} 25. Nxf5 Re1+
{a_random_guy: 26.Nf1 It's either this or 26.Kg2. Playing Kg2 would place
our king directly in the sights of their b7 bishop, so 26.Nf1 it is!  ptitroque:
26. Nf1 what else ?  bluenoser: 26. Nf1 Pretty much forced.  roneshet:
Nf1 It was the plan, all along... Next, They need to protect two places
at once. h4, and d7.} 26. Nf1 Be4 {roneshet: Rxh4 The way I see it, this
is the only move that do not lead to checkmate or losing our Q... Rxh4
Bxd3 Rxf4 Rxf1 Kg2 ....  ptitroque: roneshed I believe you're correct.
We do not have much choice.} 27. Rxh4 Qg5+ {roneshet: Rg4 Only move I see
that don't causes us to lose the queen. Open for other options...  ptitroque:
Rg4 I do not see anything else.} 28. Rg4 Qxg4+ {roneshet: f3xG4 No other
chice...} 29. fxg4 Bxd3 {ptitroque: 30... Ne3 for obvious reasons.  Ng3
also does the job but our knight would be less centered  roneshet: Ne3
I like this option better. Here the knight defends g4, and blocks the e
column.  a_random_guy: Resign We can't prevent 30...Bxf1, leaving us in
a very disfavorable endgame position where their rook can easily pick off
our stranded pawns.  ptitroque: Resign It's indeed a desperate situation.}
30. N5e3 {jkarp: I wasn't sure about resigning depending on what they do
next.  bluenoser: Best to Wait I think that is the right call and see what
they do.} Bxf1 {bluenoser:  Nxf1 I don't believe we got anything else.
I believe our game is lost now for sure.  a_random_guy: Resign We can't
stop 31.Nxf1 Ra1 winning our a pawn.  bluenoser: Resign I agree, appeared
our game was lost for sure.  roneshet: study? Nxf1 Well, can't we study
something from this part of the game? Maybe we need to stay and try to
do our best.  bluenoser: Nxf1 leaves us with N vs R I believe this game
Resignable What could we possibly learn from this point. I am all eyes!
They would have to screw up bad for us to have any chances what so ever
which I don't see happening.  jkarp: Yes, we have resigned here. At some
point, I'll be annotating this game for ION's analysis.   bluenoser: Annotating
this for analysis This is where we will actually learn something from where
we went wrong and I believe there may have been several bad moves. The
analysis will help us learn.  roneshet: Annotating this for analysis This
is where we will actually learn something from where we went wrong and
I believe there may have been several bad moves. The analysis will help
us learn.  In the end, I also sent a resignation note to the opposing team.
 GG, but our team can agree that this game is lost.   }  0-1
