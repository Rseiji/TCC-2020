{Attempting to control both the black and the white center squares. } Bg7
4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nc3 d6 6. Nf3 Nbd7 7. O-O e5 8. e4 c6 {If White now exchanges
the central Pawns, Black would have an outpost on Q5 and White would not.
} 9. Be3 {Inviting 9... Kt-Kt5. } Ng4 10. Bg5 Qb6 {White was expecting
10... P-B3 11 B-B1 P-KB4.} 11. h3 exd4 {A temporary sacrifice.} 12. Na4
Qa6 13. hxg4 b5 {Recovering the piece at the cost of a weak long diagonal,
which White immediately exploits. } 14. Nxd4 bxa4 15. Nxc6 {This Knight
can only be captured at the cost of the Exchange. But if Black plays 15...
B-Kt2, on 16 Kt-K7 ch the weak Black Pawns would be a fatal handicap. So
Black elects to eliminate the pawn weaknesses at the cost of the Exchange.
} Qxc6 16. e5 Qxc4 17. Bxa8 Nxe5 {Black threatens to win a second piece
for the Rook via 18... BxP. White's best move is 18 QxQP. } 18. Rc1 Qb4
19. a3 {Black prepares to seize the long diagonal with... B-Kt2. } Qxb2
20. Qxa4 Bb7 21. Rb1 {A blunder. The best line for White is 21 BxB QxB

both players. } Nf3+ {The White KB is still on the board, but the diagonal
is no longer in its control. } 22. Kh1 Bxa8 {Much better than 22... Kt-Q7
dis ch 23 BxB KtxQR 24 B-QB6, which would leave equal chances for both
players. } 23. Rxb2 Nxg5+ 24. Kh2 Nf3+ 25. Kh3 Bxb2 26. Qxa7 Be4 {Preventing
White from playing R-QKt1, and threatening R-R1 winning the White QRP.
} 27. a4 Kg7 28. Rd1 Be5 29. Qe7 Rc8 {Threatens mate in 3 (...R-B7, ...RxP,
...R-R7). If White tries 30 RxP, trying to break the power of the two Bishops
by offering the Exchange, 30... R-B8 forces mate. } 30. a5 Rc2 31. Kg2
Nd4+ 32. Kf1 Bf3 33. Rb1 Nc6 {White resigns, as Black has the crushing
threat of ...B-Q5. White cannot stop this without ruinous material loss.
