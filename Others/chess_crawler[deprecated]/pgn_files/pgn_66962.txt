1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Qa5 {The stilleto attack. Dubious reputation} 3. c3 {Preparing
d4} d6 4. a4 Bg4 5. Bb5+ Bd7 6. b4 {Blundering a pawn. After 6.... cxb4
7. cxb4 Qxb4 white has nothing, and still has to defend the pawn on e4}
Qc7 {?} 7. h3 {Quite unnecessary. Perhaps 0-0 should have been considered,
with d4 in mind} Bxb5 8. axb5 cxb4 9. Qb3 a6 10. Qxb4 a5 11. Qd4 Nf6 12.
b6 {Look how fast it gets crazy. Should have castled!!} Qc6 13. d3 e5 {The
antipositional thrust e5, a move that has not been refuted to date in these
Sicilian type positions} 14. Qe3 a4 {What is the idea behind this move?
Perhaps sanity was better with Be7 and 0-0} 15. g4 {White responds aggressively}
Ra6 {Black wants to munch pawns at the expense of his development} 16.
Nbd2 {Hanging the pawn on c3} Rxb6 17. Nc4 Ra6 18. Ba3 {White's development
is almost complete} d5 {Black breaking in the centre while his development
is incomplete.....what a recipe!} 19. Ncxe5 {Blunder, as black shows} Qxc3+
20. Ke2 {No castling now for white. Black should aim to get his king away
from the centre quickly} dxe4 21. dxe4 Qc2+ 22. Nd2 {He disregards this
principle} Re6 23. Rhc1 Qxe4 {And blunders the queen lol! What does he
have after Nxe4? Yeah....you got that right.... precisely NOTHING!!} 24.
