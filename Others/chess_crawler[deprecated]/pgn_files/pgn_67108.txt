1. e4 {In this game I win quickly with a standard sacrifice - however I
found out during analysis that it is not sound!} e6 {He plays the French
Defence. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence
between the cities of London and Paris in 1834. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence}
2. d4 {I didn't really want to play in this match, but a player dropped
out a few days before.} d5 {It was in Division 3 of the Chester &amp; District
Chess League.} 3. Nc3 {This is the main line.} Bb4 {This is the Winawer
Variation. Black pins the Nc3 and threatens d5xe4. It is named after Szymon
Winawer and pioneered by Nimzowitsch and Botvinnik} 4. e5 {The normal reply,
 gaining space and hoping to show that Black's b4-bishop is misplaced.}
c5 {The usual move.} 5. a3 {Also usual, play normally continues Bxc3+ 6.
bxc3, but...} cxd4 {My book on The French Defence, by Glogoric, Uhlmann,
Botvinnik and Karpov says that this move has 'almost disappeared from tournament
practice'. } 6. axb4 {So I take.} dxc3 {He takes back.} 7. bxc3 {I took
back, almost without thinking. My book mentions 7. Nf3 or 7. Qg4 as the
usual moves here, but to me this simply recapture looked normal. Using
an opening database, I see that those two moves are more popular, but don't
necessarily score better.} Qc7 {This is the drawback with the move - black
goes a pawn up anyway. However white has enough compensation.} 8. Nf3 {The
most popular move, but I found out later that 8. f4 scores better. I wanted
to get on with my development.} Qxc3+ {So he took.} 9. Bd2 {The only move
on my opening databases.} Qc7 {The queen drops back. Again the only move
in my databases.} 10. Bd3 {I continue to develop. I have compensation for
the pawn in better development, and a lovely half open a file.} Ne7 {He
develops too.} 11. O-O {I castle.} O-O {He follows suit, but at the time
I thought it was a mistake.} 12. Bxh7+ {In the 14 games on Gameknot that
this position was reached, only one game featured this standard sacrifice
- gtemple (2061) vs. serj_md (1789) Started: 02-Sep-13, Ended: 26-Sep-13.
My version of Fritz prefers 12. Re1, we will see why soon.} Kxh7 {He takes.
I thought at the time 12....Kh8 was the only way to continue, after all
as he was  pawn up before, he is still level on material. I was wrong.}
13. Ng5+ {I throw in a check. Now what we both missed at the time was 13....Kg8
14. Qh5 (threatening mate on h7) Qxc2! and black covers the mating square
h7, with advantage to black!} Kg6 {Luckily for me, he tries this. } 14.
Qg4 {With the threat of mate with 15. Nxe6 Kh7 16. Qxg7. Fritz thinks 14.....f5
is best, when 15. Qh4 leads to a advantage of plus 2.88 to white, although
I would have been tempted by the simpler f5 15.	Nxe6+	fxg4 16.	Nxc7	followed
by Nxa8.} Nf5 {He tries this, which saves his king (at least in the short
term)} 15. Nxe6+ {But not his queen. Black resigns. Thank you for reading,
please leave a comment or two and rate my annotation on the star system.
Until next time dear reader!}  1-0
