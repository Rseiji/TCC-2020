1. d4 {Have you ever won a best game prize dear reader? I have, once, with
this game, a long, long time ago. As I received it, I was reminded that
the late, great John Littlewood had not entered any of his games, and if
he had, he almost certainly would have won this prize - as well as the
prize he won for winning the tournament.} Nf6 {I have played Andrew J Mort
since then - I think there is at least one other game with him in my annotations.
He is a few years older than me and at the time had a much higher grade.
} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {Standard Grünfeld Defence} 4. cxd5 {He plays the
exchange variation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence#Exchange_Variation:_4.cxd5_Nxd5_5.e4}
Nxd5 5. e4 {He grabs the centre.} Nxc3 {I take.} 6. bxc3 {He takes back.}
Bg7 {I complete the fianchetto https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto}
7. Bc4 {He plays the old main line. For decades, theory held that the correct
method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5,
playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. It was generally
thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it
allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late
1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to
play the Exchange Variation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to
remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting
to hinder the development of Black's queenside. Another, relatively recently
developed system involves quickly playing Be3, Qd2, and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify
White's centre, remove White's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable
an early d5 push by White.  Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand are the
leading practitioners as White, and Ľubomír Ftáčnik has had many fine results
with the black pieces} O-O {I castle.} 8. Ne2 {He continues with his plan.}
c5 {I strike at the centre.} 9. O-O {He castles. } Nc6 {I develop my knight,
attacking d4 for the 4th time.} 10. Be3 {And he protects it.} Qc7 {One
of the 3 variations in the Grünfeld Defence that is names after Vasily
Smyslov, World Chess Champion from 1957 to 1958. However this move has
rather been put out of fashion by 11. Rc1 Rd8 12. Bf4! so nowadays more
common is an older line Bg4 11.f3 Na5 12.Bxf7+} 11. Rc1 {He develops his
rook.} Rd8 {I develop mine.} 12. f4 {He starts his king's side attack.}
Bg4 {I pin his knight on e2.} 13. f5 {He continues with his king's side
advance.} Na5 {I attack his bishop, daring him to take on f7. Later I did
have a game which continued with 14.	Bxf7+	Kxf7 15.	fxg6+	Kxg6, the point
being 16. Nf4+ can be met with Qxf4!} 14. Bd3 {But he played a more sensible
move.} Nc6 {This move is a mistake, I was rather hoping for 15.	Bc4	Na5
16.	Bd3	Nc6 and draw agreed.} 15. fxg6 {But he plays this.} hxg6 {I take
back.} 16. Bc4 {Attacking f7} e6 {Protecting.} 17. Bg5 {Attacking my rook.
Find black's next move.} cxd4 {Would you have played this? I felt it was
best and still do! Fritz agrees!} 18. Bxd8 {He takes the rook.} Rxd8 {I
take back.} 19. cxd4 {He takes back. At the time I thought it was a mistake
as I win back the exchange and end up a pawn up. I thought it was better
for him just to lose the second pawn so I end up with bishop and two pawns
for the rook. However my version of Fritz seems to think it is the best
move.} Bxd4+ {At the time I thought this was clearly best, winning back
the exchange, but Fritz tells me Nxd4 was better.} 20. Kh1 {The king moves
out of the way.} Be3 {Bishop moves in, attacking the rook on c1 and discovering
an attack on the queen.} 21. Qc2 {So the queen moves.} Bxe2 {All those
years ago I gave myself an exclamation mark for this move. I am not sure
why. Fritz prefer the immediate BxRc1} 22. Bxe2 {He takes back. As Fritz
points out, it is better to recapture with the queen. Can you see why dear
reader?} Bxc1 {I take the rook. As Fritz points out it would have been
more accurate to first play 22.....Rd2! which more or less forces 23. Qc4
and then 23....Rd4! and after the queen moves, capture the rook on c1 and
black has improved the position of his rook.} 23. Qxc1 {He takes back.
I am just a clear pawn up here. } Qa5 {Attacking a2. Not really bad, but
Fritz prefers Rd4} 24. Qf4 {Attacking f7.} Rd7 {Protecting f7.} 25. Bc4
{Protecting a2.} Qd2 {Offering a queen swap. } 26. Qg3 {His queen drops
back.} Qd6 {Offering another queen swap.} 27. Qf2 {Avoiding the exchange.}
Qd4 {Again, offering the exchange. Bc4 and e4 are threatened too.} 28.
Qc2 {So this is forced. } Qd2 {Again threatening the exchange of queens.
Fritz prefers Qe3.} 29. Qb1 {He avoids again.} Qb4 {I offer the exchange
again. Fritz prefers Ne5} 30. Bb5 {He finally allows the exchange of queens.}
Qxb1 {So I take.} 31. Rxb1 {He takes back.} Rd4 {I attack e4} 32. Bxc6
{He takes.} bxc6 {I take back.} 33. Rc1 {He attacks c6} Rxe4 {But he can't
take it right away as 34. Rxc6?? Re1#} 34. h3 {So he prevents back rank
mates.} Ra4 {2 clear pawns up now!} 35. Rxc6 {He takes.} Rxa2 {I take.}
36. Kh2 {King comes up for the endgame} a5 {Passed pawns must be pushed!}
37. Kg3 {King comes round again.} a4 {Pawn forward again.} 38. Ra6 {Rook
behind! } a3 {Onward Christian soldiers!} 39. Kf3 {King thinks about coming
across. He was running short of time by now.} Ra1 {I make way for the pawn
to advance again.} 40. Kg4 {He now realises that he can't come across.}
a2 {So I advance again.} 41. g3 {He shuffles his pawn} Kg7 {My king comes
up.} 42. Kh4 {He sorts of wastes a move.} Kh6 {And I stay near his king.
I have an easy winning plan of driving his king to the f file and then
playing Rf1+ followed by a2-a1=Q White resigned. Thank you for reading.
