{This was an interesting game between my student, Erika, and Ole.  It's
worth noting that Erika asked me to annotate this game.  And, there were
a lot of twists and turns with back and forth blunders from both sides
which is to be expected from both sides.  When Erika had a win, there was
a missed opportunity, but she played extremely well in the very end and
forced.  As her opponent no chance of counterplay.} 1. e4 {So, Ole starts
off conventionally.} e5 {As does Erika.} 2. Nf3 {This is what I'd expect
to see in 1.e4 e5 openings.} Nf6 {A little more common is 2...Nc6 and can
lead to interesting variations like the Ruy Lopez or Guaco Piano.  But,
there's nothing wrong with this move, as it is the Petrov Defense.} 3.
Nc3 {Having said that, I understand why Ole would played this as it is
a natural developing move.  But, slightly better was 3.Nxe5 as that's the
main move with this defense.  Afterwhich, black exchanges starting with
3...d6, and when white retreats, black has 4...Nxe4.} Nc6 {We're now into
the Four N's game.  However, this was played for the wrong reason.  I don't
think that Erika did this to develop alone, but rather, it's because her
opponent played this move.  It's, as ION calls it, 'ill advised' to make
a move just because your opponent did so.  That's important, Erika as the
reason behind this is because, at some point, you might have to stop copying
his or her move when the opponent places you in check.  And, if they're
white, they'll end up with an advantage since white is always the first
to move.} 4. Bd3 {?! I don't like this move.  It develops, but it also
blocks the center pawn.  Better was 4.Bc4 or 4.Bb5.} Bd6 {?! And, this
is proof that Erika played this because her opponent did so.  Remember
what I posted above about copying your opponent, Erika.} 5. O-O {I would've
castled here.} O-O {Like before, this is the right move but for the wrong
reason.  } 6. Bb5 a6 {Now this makes me happy, as it's where Erika stops
copying her opponent.  My guess is that this is where she took previous
notes about that, and maybe realized it was starting to happen again. 
So, she stopped herself and went after the N.} 7. Bc4 Na5 {It attacks the
N and gains tempo, so I understand why Erika played this.  But, slightly
better was 7...b5, and from there, we can see where it goes.  As right
now, the N also doesn't belong on the rim.  Either way, advancing the b
pawn would be an inconvenience to Ole because he either has to block the
center with 8.Bd3 or 8.Be2  Or the only other alternative would be 8.Bb3,
and then would be the time would be to play 8...Na5, as now Ole would be
forced to exchange his less active N for Erika's more active B.} 8. d3
{?! This is not so good as it severly limits Ole's Bc4.  Before it covered
6 squares, but with this move, it only covers 4.  That's important because
if Erika were to attack, it would need to cover e2 or d3 to prevent an
exchange.  } Qe8 {Having said that, best was 8...b5 to force this exchange.}
9. Be3 {Meanwhile, Ole completes his development.} Ng4 {Trying to ruin
Ole's K side pawn structure.} 10. Bd5 {?! Preventing Erika from exchanging
his LSB, but best was 10.Bd2 or 10.Bg5  I think that retreating back to
d2 is better because if 10.Bg5, Erika can attack again 10...f6 or 10...h6.
 This move allows Erika to expose black's K which would give more then
a slight advantage.} Nf6 {With that being said, best was 10...Nxe3.} 11.
b4 {? Waisting no time in going after the N.  But, this was Ole's first
mistake.  Having said that, what should black do next, Erika?  As a hint,
11.a3 was much better, first.} Nb3 {?? Having said that, best was 11...Bxb4.
 And, this was a blunder because of what Ole does next which will an entire
piece.} 12. axb3 c6 {But, Erika is trying to win back.} 13. Qd2 {?? Getting
the R's connected which is generally a good idea.  But, no was not the
time because of what Erika does next which should, pretty much, equalize
the game.  Instead of being an entire piece up, Ole should only be a pawn
ahead.} cxd5 14. exd5 Nxd5 {?? But, this was a serious oversight from Erika.
 It looked an extra pawn that she would win, but black overlooked that
d5 was protected by Ole's Nc3 which will enable him to win back a piece,
again.} 15. Nxd5 b5 {I don't understand this move, but best was 15...Qd8
as white could liquidate which would be to his advantage since he's ahead.}
16. Nc7 {?? I understand this move since it forks Q+R.  And, it normally
works, but that is not the case here.  As Ole forgot about Erika's Bd6.
 Having said that and what I posted above, best was 16.Nb6 forcing Erika
to liquidate B for N.  And, since she's behind this would favor Ole as
black would have even less pieces to work with in the endgame.  It wasn't
just somehow who I didn't like, but GM Susan Polgar also emphasized where
liquidation generally favors the one that's ahead in the endgame.  I know
that it's not the always the case because of extenuating circumstances
that ION mentioned, but those circumstances are rare which he also implied.
 With this move, Erika can and will compensate for material loss and level
out the game, again. } Bxc7 17. Rae1 {Centralizing one of his R's which
is what I'd do.  But, I would've done this with the other R, would've played
17.Rfe1, instead.  As then, I'd be able to centralize my other R with 17.Rad1
 I also would've considered 17.Bc5 to attack black's Rf8, but of course
that can, easily, be disputed with 17...d6.} a5 {This is an interesting
move by Erika.  But, I would've played 17...Bb7, threatening to exchange
and ruin Ole's K side pawn structure.} 18. c3 {Defending b4, but what Ole
didn't realize is that it's protected by his Q.  That's perfectly fine
as I've forgotten that, myself.  But, I would've played 18.Qe2 or 18.Ng5
for the same reason that bhidragon swarmed in with his Q after making a
terrible blunder with ...c3, as opposed to, I believe it was ...Nbd7 which
ION mentioned.  As I would try to bring some pieces in to attack black's
monarch in a very similar way.  What's important to note is that after
Ng5 combined with Qd2-h5 white has some nasty threats that isn't so easy
for black to drive off.} axb4 {Having said that, this is also what I would've
played.  I'm real picky about when to exchange pieces because of what Ken
taught.  But, he also noted that you shouldn't exchange pawns just because
it's possible, but I see a reason to exchange pawns a little more often
then pieces.  This is an example because Ole is still left with doubled
pawns, and Erika now has an open file for one of her R's which can also
become dangerous for white.  I've seen similar examples of that with TA.}
19. cxb4 e4 {But, I would not have exchanged here.  Instead, I would've
attack b3 with 19...Qe6.} 20. dxe4 Bxh2+ {?? I understand this move since
it exposes Ole's K.  But, this was an oversight by Erika.  Much better
was 20...Qxe4, winning back a pawn.  This move drops a piece and leaves
Ole ahead, again.} 21. Kxh2 Ra6 {Getting her R in action.  But, being behind,
as black is, I would've played 21...Qxe4.} 22. Ra1 {And, this is an ok
move by Ole since he's threatening to liquidate.  But, better was 22.e5
to protect e4 since Erika can and will take as a little bit of compensation.}
Qxe4 23. Qd6 {?? Trying to add another to the R.  But, this is a terrible
oversight for Ole.  Much better was liquidate, once and for all, with 23.Rxa6.
 With this move, Ole goes from being ahead to far behind, so the tables
have now turned in Erika's favor.} Rxd6 24. Bc5 {Although, Ole has some
tricks up his sleeve as he attempts to get counterplay.  The idea is this
skewer since in general, it would win the exchange, R for B.  And, she
finds the next move which should prevent that.  But, it was for the wrong
reason, as we're about to see.} Rh6+ 25. Kg1 d5 {?? As Erika played 24...Rh6+
just to place her opponent in check.  I know this because she's played
other moves just to get her opponents in check.  That's also ill advised
and has costed her the game before.  Instead, the check should've been
played to protect her Rf8.  Having said that 25...Re8 or 25...Rd8 were
much better as Ole is going to win the exchange a compensation for material
lost.  } 26. Bxf8 Kxf8 27. Ra8 {Ole tries to further compensates by pinning
the Bc8.} Ke7 {?? Breaking the pin, but 27...Qe8 was essential to add a
defender to her Bc8.  With this move, Ole will win back a piece.  So, Erika
is no longer going to be far ahead.  In fact, I think that after this,
despite having had lost a Q white will have a chance to get a draw with
best play with how close it is.  It really comes down to what will happen
in the endgame.  As shamash told me which he read from somewhere, 'The
endgame is your ability to play chess.'  In most cases, I find that to
be true.  As I had some hopelessly lost positions but won due to mistakes
that my opponent or two made during the endgame.} 28. Rxc8 Qf5 {I also
would've played this.  But, the reason is because Erika is threatening
mate.  Having said that, I'd follow up with a later ...Qh5 which would
force white to move his Rf1 to prevent mate or lose the Nf3.} 29. Re1+
{Having said that, white sees through it and answers with a check.  I would've
played 29.Rec1, but that move is still possible, and Ole is about to play
it on his next move.} Kd7 30. Rec1 Qf4 {I don't understand this move since
Ole's Rc1 is protected by his Rc8.  Instead, as with before, I would've
attempted to swarm in with 30...Qh4, and after something like 31.Kf1 (to
prevent mate), I'd quick play 31...Qxb4 to grab another pawn.} 31. R8c7+
Qxc7 {I understand this move, but I would've played 31...Kd6  I don't mind
liquidation, but I wouldn't want to hand back black Q.  Having said that,
I think that Erika chose wisely because she's still ahead, when all is
said and done and has a passed pawn, as well.} 32. Rxc7+ Kxc7 33. Kf1 {I
like this move.  Although it doesn't accomplish that much since Erika doesn't
have a mate, we're well into the endgame.  So, the K becomes a weapon now.}
Rh1+ {I'm not surprised to see Erika played this.  As noted before, she
still puts her opponent in check when possible which is not great.  But,
I would've played 33...Rd6  GM Susan Polgar, as well as, Coach Stockel,
and ION emphasized that you should bring the R behind a passed pawn.  That
kind of thing often that makes them unstoppable.  In case Erika is wondering,
since I was wanted to know what they were for a while, a passed pawn is
a pawn that does not have pawns or piece to the side of or in front of
the pawn.  That is the case with the d5 pawn here.} 34. Ng1 {?? Instead
of interposing, I would've gotten out of check with 34.Ke2 as this leaves
the N pinned.  And, in doing so, Ole has tied it down which is to Erika's
advantage.  In fact, as I noted earlier, I think that Ole had a chance
of getting a draw.  But, with this move, all hopes are now gone, as Erika
has a win now.  Even if she doesn't find it right away, it's going to happen,
sooner or later, at this point which is why I'm giving this move 2 queries.}
d4 35. g4 {Trying to stop Erika from getting another passed pawn.} g5 {But,
Erika has other ideas.} 36. Kg2 {I'm not surprised to see Ole go on the
offense.  The idea is, as ION put it to, 'Play the man, not the board'
when your losing.  But, Erika has an attack of her own, on the next move.}
Rh4 37. f3 d3 {And, with that, she keeps pushing her passed pawn which
is the saying with passers.} 38. Kg3 {?? I don't get this move since her
Rh4 was protected by the g5 pawn.  Essential was to stop a passer with
38.Kf1.  In fact, this should give Erika a win which is why I marked it
with 2 queries.  } Rh1 {?! Having said that, I understand this move.  But,
Ole will protect by attacking the R.  Similar to my game with anitam which
I lost in a won position, 39...d2 was called for.  This would've forced
a win, once and for all.  In fact, I bet that if you had played this, Ole
would resign on the very next move, Erika.  Erika becomes a little too
confident which I understand, as that's how I thought against anitam. 
She has a win which makes it very easy to underestimate her opponent because
the thought is that no matter what I do or play next, I'm going to win
which is true here.  But, that's not the right approach, and one can and
does go very wrong thinking this way Erika.  Remember what Coach Stockel
taught me which you've seen in your annotations.  'When you think that
you have won or are in a winning position, be very careful and do not underestimate
your opponent.  Otherwise, you might start making mistakes and losing the
game.'  And, although your games are under control, I think that your moving
a little too quick Erika.  As you have an average time control of under
3 hours.  And, you have 3 bars lit which means that you're moving several
times per day.  Don't forget that you have days to make a move on GK, so
you're gonna want to slow down your pace a little bit.} 39. Kg2 d2 {??
As Ken put it, timing can be essential.  And, it was here, as this would've
immediately won a move earlier.  But, it's a blunder now since Ole is about
to pick up a R.  Best was 39...Rh6  And, with this move, Ole has a better
chance of getting a draw with best play.  This is another example of where
I think that you moved a little too quickly, Erika.  Afterall slow and
steady wins the race.  Upon, finally, following a mentors advice of not
playing too much at once, I learned to think more like Turtoise then that
of the hair.  As the saying goes, 'slow and steady wins the race.'  That
applies in chess, as well.  } 40. Kxh1 d1=Q 41. Kg2 {Breaking the pin and
trying to do some damage with the N.  But, Erika is about to win another
pawn.} Qxb3 42. Kf2 {Fighting hard for the draw since he's protecting f3,
but Erika fights back as she will make another capture on her next move.}
Qxb4 43. Ne2 {But, this is where you start to see some of Ole's strategies.
 As there's more then a little that white can do with his N.} Qc5+ {As
before, one shouldn't check the opponent because it's possible.  Instead,
I would've pinned with 43...Qb2 as I wouldn't take any chances with white's
Ne2.  } 44. Kf1 {I would've played 44.Kg3 with the idea of 45.f4.  Although,
Erika has ideas with her passed pawn.  So, I think that this is the best
move, as this gives him a chance to stop the passer, and thus, an increased
shot at a draw.} b4 {Remembering what I previously said which was implied
earlier in the game.  'Passed pawns must be pushed.'} 45. f4 {I would've
considered 45.Ke1, but I think that this is white's best move.  This exchange
is going to help white.  } gxf4 {With that being said, I would've stopped
whites counterplay with either 45...h6 or 45...f6.} 46. Nxf4 f5 {?? And,
this is where Erika blunders, and I hold true that white had a chance of
getting a draw.  If white doesn't make any more mistakes, I believe that
it, very well, might happen.  Having said that, you also had a forced win
here, Erika.  Now would've been the time to throw in a check, as best was
to fork with 46...Qc4+.  This would've won the N, and as with before, it
would've won, at once since you'd win the g4 pawn, soon after.  Even if
he wouldn't have before, after picking up the N, I am 100% certain that
Ole would've resigned.   As he would've realized his fate with only his
monarch against your Q+3 pawns, which is the equivalent to a piece with
it.   And, add that with the K and mate would not be far off.  This is
where slowing down also would've made the difference.  } 47. Ne6+ Kd6 48.
Nxc5 Kxc5 49. gxf5 {?? Although it looks good since it, temporarily, wins
back a pawn, this was the final mistake from Ole that'll seal his fate.
 This would've been better much later on.  But, up until now, he had a
chance at a draw, but 49.Ke1 was essential.  For example, we'd have a stalemate
after 49.Ke1 b3 50.Kd1 Kc4 51.Kc1 Kc3 52.Kb1 b2.  And, now 53.gxf5 h5 54.f6
h4 55.f7 h3 56.f8=Q h2 57.Qf1 h1=Q 58.Qxh1 Kb3  This is a classic example,
and I studied a similar example with Coach Stockel.  By him capturing now,
Erika now has a forced win which she will take advantage of, once and for
all.    } b3 {So, she starts by pushing her passed pawn, again.} 50. f6
{And, Ole tries to counter that, by pushing his passed pawn.} b2 {But,
Erika is, basically, telling him that it's too little too late. } 51. f7
b1=Q+ {As Erika has repromoted.  And, similar to when I lost against anitam,
she's not going to let Ole go far, this time around.} 52. Kg2 Qb8 {As Erika
is ready for when Ole promotes.} 53. f8=Q+ Qxf8 {And, with that, Ole resigns
right here for the same reason that he would've resigned, had Erika played
46...Qc4+ at once.  My recommendation for both players is that they slow
down and take a little more time before moving.  As I looked at Ole's time
control, and his average time per move is a little longer.  But, similarly,
he makes moves several times per day.  I'd try to limit that to, at most,
one move per day.  I think, from my own experience, that slowing down the
pace would've caused Erika and her opponent to find the right moves earlier
in the game, reducing or even, eliminating, the blunders. }  0-1
