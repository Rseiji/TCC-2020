{This was a long game between Erika and Russel which was full of blunders.
 But, similar to what we've seen previously, my student asked me to annotate
this game.  There is an interesting moment in this game.   Upon Russel
making a final blunder and having a lost position, Erika miscalculated
and let the position repeat itself.  This could've allowed white to pull
a swindle and declare a draw by repetition.  Not seeing the opportunity,
Erika saw that opportunity and delivered a checkmate, once and for all.
 Before the position repeated itself, Erika overlooked some moves that
would've immediately mated, but that is how the game ended.  So, how did
it all go down?} 1. d4 {I wasn't sure what Russel was going to play, but
I'm not surprised to see the QPO.  Erika has annotated games that started
off this way, and it's a common move in the beginning.  In fact, Erika,
most often, plays 1.e4, but my student, sometimes, plays this first move.
 Her next move will be 1...d5 as I've told her that this is the most common
to this move.} d5 2. Nc3 {I used to mark this move as dubious, but I'm
not really sure that it is.  One thing for sure is that I, personally,
find fault with this move and don't like it.  I don't feel the same way
in 1.e4 opening, but this blocks Russel's c pawn which is like a center
pawn in QPO's.  However, I also know that it isn't super important since
ION said that in a different annotation.  Not only that, but GM Susan Polgar
didn't say anything against playing Nc3 ...Nc6 after 1.d4 or 1...d5 which
is how I also realized that it's not super important despite once being
told that a GM lost by blocking his c pawn.  Although I was told that by
the very same player that I and others blocked.  And, up until I read ION's
comment, I was very critical of that c pawn for 1.d4 d5 openings.} Bf5
{I like this move a lot since it develops.  } 3. e4 {? Trying to attack
it, but this is a mistake that will allow Erika to win a pawn.} dxe4 4.
Nxe4 {?? But, Russel didn't think it did since he played this.  And, I
can easily relate to how's he thinking since I thought the same way against
Kenneth_fiore_3 in one of our training games.  However, that way of thinking
will cause the same problem that my way of thinking caused which is the
lost of material since nothing is protecting white's Ne4.  Having said
that, with best play from Erika black can win, but this is where you have
to take your time and be careful as Coach Stockel emphasized to me when
I lost a tournament game that I ought to have won.} Bxe4 5. Bb5+ {Trying
to get counterplay, but what Erika does next is how I also would've responded.}
c6 {Very understandable since it forces the } 6. Bc4 {Before you continue
playing on stop and take a breather, Erika.  You have an opportunity to
do more then just a remain which would almost force a win right away. 
Before you continue reading on, try to figure out how black should continue.}
Nf6 {As, charleshiggie would ask, 'Did you find it?'  Unfortunately, you
didn't play it, but I hope that after I said something above you played
it out to find it.  Right before I continue, I know why you played this
since the idea was to continue developing and give you the opportunity
to castle.  But, this is one of those times where development ought to
have waited.  Having said that, your best move, by far, was 6...Bxg2! not
only picking up another pawn but winning an entire Rook, as well, with
an overwhelming advantage for black.  In fact, white's position would be
very near resignable, at this point.} 7. d5 {With this move, Erika still
has the option to take on g2.  But, she was worried about the pawn on c6,
and took right away to pick up another pawn, as well.  The thing to note
is that the pawn on c6 is no problem, even after winning the R, because
if after something like 7...Bxg2 8.dxc3, you'd have 9...Qxd1+ (to prevent
losing the Q and stopping white from castling), then after 10.Kxd1 bxc3
or 10...Nxc3, (to prevent him from exchanging your Ra8) his R is still
trapped on h1.  And, no matter what Russel does next, nothing stops 11...Bxh1.}
Nxd5 8. Bxd5 cxd5 9. Ne2 {Preventing Erika from winning a R, even if she
plays 9...Bxh2, which still would've been the best move since it wins,
yet, another pawn.} e6 {But, she played this to free up her Bf8.  Remember,
that as with other games, there's more to the eye here then just development.
 In fact, it also boils down to seeing the overall picture, as bhidragon
emphasized to me.  So, the thing to ask yourself, way to think is, what's
going on here, where am I going, and what I can I get.  That's in addition
to seeing other things like as ION points out tactical motifs including
the masked battery.  Those kind of things, sometimes, takes precedence
over development.  And, the reason for me emphasizing this was due to my
most recent game against bhidragon that I lost.  It was due to me thinking
about how to free the c pawn to enable my Nc6 to come out since it was
also a d4 d5 opening.  So, I played either 12...c6 or 12...c5?? which immediately
got my Q out play and allowed him to swarm in with 13.Qh5!, after which
I lost because you had his Q and then 2 or three other pieces to come in
and attack my K.  That's what also enabled him to continue the attack by
sacking his B.  So, the point then is what it is now, try broaden the spectrum
and look at everything that's happening and not just development.  I know
how difficult and even painful that is, but this is also extremely important
to becoming a better chess player.  Believe it or not, one of the main
things that helped me with this was a sentence from a chess quote from
GM Susan Polgar.  â€¦'The pain that you're suffering today can the pain you
are suffering today can bring you a lifetime of rewards.'  } 10. Nd4 {Bringing
his N to a better square.} Bb4+ {But, this was not the way to do.  I know
that you're plan was to continue developing and place your opponent in
check.  But, remember that it's sometimes not a good to play the check,
and you're ill advised to do it just because it's possible to put your
opponent in check.  The problem here is that Russel can gain a tempo.}
11. Bd2 {Having said that, his best move was 11.c6.} Bxd2+ {This wasn't
the best move either, although it does liquidate while ahead, which is
generally, to your advantage.  The problem is that your Bishop was more
active then his Bishop, so I wouldn't have accepted the exchange, especially,
since I was corrected for doing this kind too often by Ken.  Instead, 11...Bc5
was better, and if he counterattacks with 12.f3 12...Bxd4 13.fxe4 dxe4
which still picks up a pawn, and it also continues liquidating which is
to your advantage.} 12. Qxd2 Bxg2 13. Rg1 {And, even though this protects
the R, Russel can no longer castle short.  But, he still has the option
of castling long which I think would be risky.  On the other hand, I don't
think he has anything better, unless you blunder which is all that white
can hope for.} Na6 {?? And, this is a blunder which Russel should have
exploited, and it's a lot more then just the N being on the rim.  Before
you read any further, find the best move for white, Erika.} 14. Ne2 {Well,
hopefully, you found it.  He should've quick played 14.Rxg2 which would've
won back a B.} Qh4 {Going for h2 and pinning f7.  But, you should've retreated
your Bg2, since he can still take back.  But, as with before, Russel overlooked
15.Rxg2!  } 15. Qd3 O-O {It generally is a good idea to castle early, but
now was not the time to do that.  As with before, we need to be thinking
about the overall picture.  In this case, what's happening since, unlike
before, Russel will take advantage of the opportunity to grab on g2, winning
back material.} 16. Rxg2 e5 {? I don't know why Erika played this, but
best was 16...Qh3 not only attacking the R, but allowing black to pick
up a pawn on h2 when white retreats.  This would've left her the equivalent
to a piece up without compensation, but it's better then that, as we're
talking about 3 pawns up, as opposed to, just a minor piece.  ION noted
3 pawns are usually worth more then a B or N which is of same value.  And,
the reason behind is due to what the pawns are capable of in the endgame.
 Having said that, this is also a mistake as white can win back a pawn.
 Try to figure out how, Erika.} 17. O-O-O {!? The idea being is that if
I can't castle short, I'll do it long.  That's how Russel was thinking.
 But, best would've been 17.Qxd5, and now even if Erika is to play 17...Qh3,
for the reason outlined earlier, she isn't able to win another pawn.} e4
{I understand this move, but Russel will use the opportunity to grab on
d5.} 18. Qxd5 Qd8 {Wanting to exchange Q's.  But, the thing to note is
that, unlike before, you're only up a pawn now.  While 18...Qh3 was still
the best move, better then what you'd play would've been to attack the
Q with either R, 18...Rad1 or 18...Rfd1, and then after retreating and
then exchanging with 19...Rxd1+ 20.Kxd1 almost as strong as ...Qh3, would
be 20...Qh5 pinning the N which would tie down white's pieces.  And, that's
generally, not a good way to go when we're nearing the endgame.  With this
move, Erika's position is about to become passive which is not so good
either. } 19. Qxd8 Rfxd8 20. Rxd8+ Rxd8 21. f4 {?? I'm not sure what Russel
was thinking, why he played this.  But, it's a serious blunder on his part.
 In fact, as chesskingdom64 would say, 'Almost anything was better then
this move?'  Take a moment and try to figure out how black should respond,
Erika.} Nc5 {This is not easy to see, and I've overlooked this myself.
 But, your best move was 21...exf3 e.p., which would've won a piece.  And,
this time, it would have been without compensation for white.} 22. b4 {Going
after the N.} Nd3+ {?? But, this is a terrible move, and I know why Erika
played.  As with before, it was, simply, to place Russel in check.  Can
you figure out why this is a blunder, Erika?} 23. Kd2 {? The reason being
is that Russel should've answered with 23.cxd3 not only compensating for
lost material, but now, he'd be the one who's the equivalent to a pawn
up.  Having said this is a mistake, why is it so, Erika?} e3+ {It's very
easy to overlook it, but your best move was 23...Nxb4+ picking up another
pawn through a discovered check.  With this move, Russel will prevent Erika
from winning another pawn on his next move.} 24. Kxe3 Nxb4 25. c3 {Going
after the N which won't do because of Erika's next move.} Nd5+ 26. Kd4
{?? This is a blunder, and with that, how can you exploit this Erika?}
f5 {It looks difficult to near impossible to do this.  But, the answers
is with what ION calls the masked battery.  And, with that 26...Nxf4+ was
the way to go.  This fork might look ineffective, but with Russel in check,
there's no way for white to protect his Rg2.  With that Erika would, as
with a missed opportunity before, be up an entire R and pawn.  And, since
this is an endgame, he'd have very little to no chance of counterplay.}
27. c4 {Going after the N, but this allows Erika to play the masked battery
which she'll take advantage of, this time around.  Not only that, but she
will further exacerbate white's situation by rightly taking the R on g2.
 At this point, unless Erika err's, white is now busted.} Nxf4+ 28. Ke3
Nxg2+ 29. Kf2 f4 {?? Having said that, this is a blunder, Erika that should
allow some counterplay.  How can Russel do that.} 30. c5 {With 30.Kxg2.}
b6 {Trying to prevent Russel from getting a passed pawn.  But, best was
30...Rd2, pinning his Ne2 which would've also prevented him from winning
back the N.} 31. cxb6 {Still missing the opportunity to grab her N.} axb6
{Likewise, she fails to see that it's en-prise.  And, this continues for
a while, back and forth.} 32. h3 h5 33. h4 Ra8 {In fact, Erika wants a2
which would've also been available later on since there is no way to protect
it, afterall.  Likewise, Russel still forgets about Erika's Ng2.  In fact,
her best move was 33...Nxh4, winning, yet, another pawn.} 34. Nd4 {And,
with this last oversight, Erika will protect by grabbing h4, this time
around.} Nxh4 35. Nc6 {Trying to do what he can for counterplay.} Rc8 {And,
Erika's telling Russel that it's too little too late with this move.} 36.
Na7 Ra8 {In case you're wondering, Erika, this is a skewer which is the
opposite of a pin.  As now, he's forced to pull back his N which enables
to get, yet, another pawn.} 37. Nb5 Rxa2+ 38. Kf1 Ra1+ 39. Ke2 Ra2+ {I
like this move, but better was 39...f3+, and Russel gets out of check,
you'd be able to continue advancing your passed pawn to f3.  However, the
opportunity still arises after this move, but a promotion, I believe, would've
be even sooner.} 40. Kd1 {Better would've been 40.Kd3 to prevent Erika
from pushing her passed pawn under grounds of 41.Ke3, as now, it needs
to remain where it is and not advance to prevent Russel from grabbing with
his K.  With this move, her next move is just as good as it would've been
earlier, and she'll be able to promote soon.} f3 41. Nc3 {Trying to stop
further advancement by attacking the R, but it won't due because of Erika's
next move.} Ra1+ 42. Kc2 f2 {As now, she will promote on her next move.
 } 43. Nd5 f1=Q 44. Ne7+ {Trying to figure out what else he can do Russel
dishes in the check.  And, what Erika is also how I would've responded.}
Kf7 45. Nc8 b5 {Not only protecting her pawn, but trying to push it.  I
understand this attempt, but there's no need to do it, Erika.  The reason
being is that you're so far ahead that what you have is enough to checkmate
your opponent.  What's, more is that the pawn is of no concern.  Having
said that, I would've played 45.Qd1+.  As now, similar to the N+B endgame
checkmate or those other mating patterns, I'd be looking for ways to confine
the K into the corner, where it can't get out.  But, upon studying this,
I would've been a little upset with myself since there's still a small
way to deliver mate.  Having said all of that, 45...Qc1+ or 45...Rc1+ was
best, and with the skewer, you would've won his remaining piece.  That
would've only left Russel with his K against what you have which would
make it very easy for you to checkmate.} 46. Nd6+ {Protecting his N with
check.} Ke6 47. Ne8 {Going after the pawn.  Ok, Erika, what's the best
move for black here?} Ra2+ {I know how much you like these checks, but
best was 47...Qf7, trapping and winning his N.} 48. Kb3 {Unlike before,
you have something better then winning his last piece which would've ended
the game at once, Erika.  What am I alluding to?  } Qf3+ {?? 48...Qc4#
which would've been mate.  This is a blunder that will allow Russel to
win back your R.} 49. Kxa2 b4 {Going for a passed pawn, but you have so
much material, that'd I'd first be thinking about the N, Erika.  And, then,
I'd go for a checkmate.  With that being said, your best move was, similar
a couple of moves back, 50...Qe3+!  With this move, Russel will escape
with his N, for now.} 50. Nxg7+ Ke5 51. Ne8 {Still giving you the opportunity
to skewer and pick up his N.  But, you have something better, although
it's harder to see since it's several moves.} b3+ {And, with that, 51...Qf7+
was better.  But, best was 51...Qa3+, and mate is unstoppable.  For example,
52.Kb1 b3 (pinning the K) 53.Nc7 Qa2+, forcing 54.Kc1 which then allows
54...Qc2# } 52. Kb2 Ng2 {Making room for your passed pawn.  But, slightly
better would've been 52...Kd4, and the reason isn't obvious either.  The
idea being is that your bringing your K closer to his monarch and your
b3 pawn.  In fact, this is what makes the monarch dangerous in the endgame.
 Now, they're the near equivalent in value to the R.  And, it's not because
of points like pieces or pawns.  It's because, in the end, the K can guide
the pawn to a promotion, at best.  In fact, this is how I won a game against,
at the time, a much stronger player since I was still a novice back then
who even SM.  But, this is the worst case for white, and in this case,
it works together with the Q to confine his monarch to the corner where
a checkmate then ensues.} 53. Ng7 h4 {You still have the same idea, but
like before, I wouldn't have considered anything else, besides, 53...Kd4
for the same reason.  I also know that you're going to keep pushing the
pawn until it promotes.  But, as a reminder, when you're far ahead like
this, you don't need to promote to deliver checkmate.  Instead, it's better
to use what you have to do this.  The reason being is that going for a
promotion when it's not necessary can allow your opponent to pull a swindle
and draw with stalemate.  That's important because the last thing you want
to do with a won game is allow your opponent to draw or even win.  Something
like that happened to me in one or two games and I was frustrated.  And,
the first time I took the N+B endgame checkmate test, I failed by allowing
a draw by rep.  As the idea from that course is the same thing that I'm
telling you which is not to throw away a win.  In fact, this becomes very
important as we get later on due to a miscalculation that could've allowed
a draw of the same kind that I got in the test.} 54. Ne8 h3 55. Nc7 h2
56. Ne8 h1=Q {Having said that, now's even more of the time to really calculate
to prevent a swindle, Erika.  As it's important to realize that in a position
like this, all it takes is one or two miscalculations to allow a stalemate
which is where the monarch's in a place where it can't move.  But, unlike
with checkmate, it's the only spot where it's not eliminated or checkmated.
 In fact, right before the first game that I won, which was against the
same opponent, I miscalculated and allowed a stalemate by Maryrose.  At
the time, I wasn't upset myself, but that's only because it was just after
I learned some strategy in the game. } 57. Ng7 {I'm not sure what the best
move was.  I would've suggested a move to try and mate him which, I think
would end the game in checkmate.  Having said that, upon further consideration,
I would've played 57...Qh7 to trap and win the N.} Qf2+ {But, I also understand
this move, Erika, as you are going to checkmate.  In fact, this is what
I would've suggested, and I was worried about white stalemating you.  Looking
at it further, I realized that it's not possible to do so.  } 58. Kxb3
Qb1+ 59. Kc3 Qe3+ 60. Kc4 Qee4+ {I understand the checkmate ideas, and
I almost overlooked this myself.  But, your best move was 60...Q1b3# which
would've been checkmate.} 61. Kc3 Qc1+ 62. Kb3 Qd3+ {Best was 62...Qec4#
which was also checkmate.} 63. Kb4 Qd6+ {Best was 63...Qdc3+, and no matter
what Russel does next, it's mate in 3.  For example, 64.Ka4 Qb1, which
prevents the K from moving but isn't stalemate due to the N.  So, then,
for example, 65.Nf5 Qcb4#.} 64. Kb3 Qd3+ {Now, we get into confining the
K into the corner where it can't get out.  And, with that, best was 64...Qb6+,
which then forces the K onto the first rank, and then black can checkmate
on the next move, with either 65...Q6b2# or 65...Qa1#  But, at this point,
you'll need to be even more careful about not giving up the win.  As the
position starts repeating, and once the same position repeats three times,
Russel can pull a swindle by declaring a draw by repetition.} 65. Kb4 Qd4+
66. Kb5 Qd5+ 67. Kb4 Qd4+ 68. Kb5 Qd5+ {In fact, right here is where Russel
could and ought to have declared the draw by rep, since the same position
repeated itself 3 times in a row.  In fact, that's what I would've done
as black.  And, it's exactly what I did in a couple of hopelessly lost
games against Carl, including our last tournament game.} 69. Kb4 Qb2+ {Preventing
it now since the move is different.  And, with best play, Russel has no
more chances, which is exactly what happened.  There might have been, in
between the last few moves, a mate in 1 which I'm not mentioning since
you were able to keep that win and deliver the checkmate, Erika.} 70. Ka4
Qc4+ 71. Ka5 Qa3+ 72. Kb6 Qe6+ 73. Kb5 Qd7+ 74. Kc4 Qc6# {There are, however,
a couple of takeaways, lessons to be learned from this game.  First, when
you have so much material, it's not necessary to go for a promotion.  Instead,
you're better off using what you have to deliver a checkmate, Erika, especially
to prevent a swindle with a stalemate.  With that being said, the second
lesson is that when you have a win, keep and don't miscalculate.  It goes
along with what Coach Stockel said about underestimating your opponent.
 Otherwise, you could draw or even lose, an otherwise, won game which is
the last thing that you want to do.}  0-1
