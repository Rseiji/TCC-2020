1. d4 d5 2. e3 e6 3. Bb5+ c6 4. Bd3 g6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Bd2 a5 7. a3 Bxc3
8. Bxc3 a4 9. Nf3 h5 10. Ne5 f6 {So far this is a pretty typical opening.
This is my second game against this opponent, so I already sort of knew
what to expect. My opponent has a bad habit of leaving key pieces open,
which happens again in this game, as well. } 11. Nxg6 Rh7 12. Nf4 h4 {The
mistake my opponent makes in both their games against me: leaving their
pieces unguarded. I get a free rook with no threat to my bishop. } 13.
Bxh7 Nh6 14. Bg6+ Ke7 15. Qh5 Nf5 16. Qh7+ Kd6 17. Bb4+ c5 18. Bxc5+ {I've
just been checking the king multiple times and I pretty much have control
of the board now. } Kc6 19. Bxf5 exf5 {Last game against this opponent,
the knights gave me no end of trouble, so I thought I'd take one out while
I could. } 20. Qxh4 {But I get a free pawn out of the exchange, too. }
b6 {This was a good move on the part of my opponent, trying to force my
bishop back and open more space for their pieces. } 21. Bb4 Kb5 22. b3
{Now my goal is just to get rid of as many of their pieces as possible
and weaken the king's defenses. } axb3 23. cxb3 {Exchange of pawns} Qc7
24. Nxd5 {I get a free pawn. Wasn't really expecting my opponent to fall
for this--was expecting their next move to be moving the queen somewhere
else, but...} Kc6 {...now I get the queen.} 25. Nxc7 Kxc7 26. Qh7+ {And
the game is pretty much decided at this point. Five moves away from checkmate.
} Bd7 27. Rc1+ Nc6 28. d5 {Because the knight is protecting the king, I
figure I might as well help myself, otherwise the king just has a perpetual
wall around him and I don't have enough pieces to break it at this point.
} f4 29. dxc6 Kc8 {Not too smart at this point; the king gets checked again
on the next move. Might have been better to move the king to d8, but at
this point, checkmate is inevitable. } 30. Qxd7+ Kb8 31. Qb7# {And mate.
I noticed that the rook on the a column never actually moved (well, neither
did one of my rooks, but I never needed it). Black would have done well
to keep a tighter hold on their pieces, perhaps even using the 'analyze
the board' option to play ahead several moves and see what works best.
}  1-0
