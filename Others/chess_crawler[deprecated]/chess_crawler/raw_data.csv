,Strange idea, since after the exchanges still a piece gets on e6, but I see the plan with the pawn d5. I miss tempoes to unravel myself, and now, Be8 just leads to Qxe6, winning.

"This is an interesting game. My opponent plays the opening fine. I am just getting to the end of my opening database line, when he makes a mistake. The first move of the combination is not original. Although he has an equal position after 12 moves, mistakes on move 13, 14, 16 and 17 lead to a hopeless position. My opponent resigns rather than prolonging the agony. 
,So he keeps the position symmetrical, at least for now.
,The Queen's Gambit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Gambit
,Queen's Gambit Accepted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit_Accepted
,This variation quickly regains the pawn for white.
,Sensible development. 
,I regain the pawn.
,He blocks the diagonal for my Bishop.
,I prepare to castle.
,This is thematic, striking at the centre. 
,I carry out my plan.
,This is again often played in this variation.
,According to the Gameknot World Opening database, this is the most common move in the variation. White prepares to temporarily sacrifice a pawn. 
,He doesn't take. The pawn sacrifice line is instead 7....cxd4 8. Rd1
,My rook comes across anyway.
,And he castles.
,My other knight eventually comes out.
,Preparing a queen-side advance.
,I take, discovering an attack on his queen.
,So he moves his queen.

"the Ruy Lopez, probably one of the most analyzed opening systems in the world; played for the first time in my life...
,the usual and strongest reply...  other options are the Cordel variation Bc5, c3, Nf6, d4 - reminiscent to the Italian Party - or the Bird defense Nd4, Nxd4, exd4, 0-0, c6, Bc4, Nf6, bringing us back to Italian lines again...
,again the usual and strongest reply... another option is the Exchange variation Bxc6, dxc6, 0-0; brought to life again by Fischer at Havana 1966...
,business as usual; White could also consider the ancient Steinitz favorite d3, which is a bit slow, but very playable for White; which again Fischer showed us on several occasions in tournament play... we will try this on a next occasion...
,from here, Black has usually three choices; a) open defense: Nxe4, d4, b5, Bb3, d5, dxe5, Be6, c3; b) closed defense: Be7, Re1, b5, Bb3, d6, c3, 0-0; c) d6 defense: d6, Re1, b5, Bb3, Na5, d4, Nxb3... in this game, Black clearly hasn't decided yet...
,Black clearly ran out of theory already, and is trying to make a futile point about e4; giving White time for additional development...
,introducing Nd5 into the mixture... another strong option here is the usually played (Fischer) a4, to release Bb3, but Nc3 makes this all the more stronger after Bb7; plus: e4 is suddenly covered...
,Black closes his defenses; since we are preparing Nd5, we pass on a direct d4, exd4, Nxd4, Nxd4, Qxd4, c5!, Qe3, with too much complications; this old Steinitz move covers e4 after Nd5...
,a clever addition, if I may say so myself; keeping an eye on b4 and a5 after Nd5...
,Black wants to complete his development; best is first Nd4, Nxd4 (Nxe5, b4!, Ne2, Nxb3, axb3, d5! (ruining my plans), exd5, Qxd5), exd4, to simplify before Nd5 hits...
,now or never; this will clear a path either for c4 or d4, after an additional c3...
,not the best: Black should be preparing Nd8 (Na5 is impossible) to trade Bd5, and prepare c6 or c5; Qd7 (solves it rightaway) or Qc8 (supports c6/c5) were options...
,we need not protect a5 anymore, since Bb3 has been replaced, and cover the all important c5; after Na5, a4!, Bxd5, exd5, b4, Nd2, c6, Qf3, followed by c3 or c4, White has the better of the play... this is preventing Nd4, and preparing d4...
,not better, than the above variation for Black; this might well be the losing move already...
,still theory; enforcing d4, and preventing Nb4...
,underestimating the situation; needed was a way to put the Knight elsewhere, like Qd7, followed by Nd8; this will soon go sour...
,this move is what this variation is all about, and worth waiting for; now, Bd5 might even retreat to a2... needless to say, that also axb5 is a big problem; after c6, Ba2, threatening b4... Blacks' Queens' wing is about to fall apart, thanks to Rb8...
,not better than above variation; Black needs to find a way to cover for Na5...
,long overdue and a clear mistake at this point; last option was c5 (covers Na5), axb5, axb5, Nd2 (against e4, supporting c4), Ra8...
,no other option left; (also) after Rxb5, c4, and after e4, Nd2, leaves Na5 lost... after Nb7, bxa6, Nc5, b4, e4, bxc5, exf3, Qxf3, Bxc3, Ra3, Bb4, c6!, Black can start worrying...

"Last night's match was against the division leaders, who outgraded us comprehensively on all boards.  We were, and remain, in second place, despite losing 2-4, made up of draws on the top 4 boards and losses on boards 5 and 6.
,The Sicilian Dragon: against which I have had limited success in the past.
,A standard move that prepares Be3 and a kingside pawnstorm.  I believe that the usual strategy is that White castles queenside and Black castles kingside.  Then they race to break open the enemy kings' positions.
,Not sure that this is standard but it seemed good at the time: it attacks the normally weak f7 pawn and prepares to defend the pawns in front of a queenside-castled king.  It also gives White the option of castling kingside.
,I'd expected Black to castle immediately but he delayed that in favour of preparing to control the half-open c-file.
,Preparing both queenside castling and attacking the fianchettoed bishop, but I have to be careful not to over-burden my queen with defending both Bh6 and Nd4.
,Black plays very actively, preparing to get his attack in first.
,I didn't want this B exposed to a discovered attack, eg 10. ...Nxd4 11.Qxd4 Nh5 especially as I wanted to play Bh6 soon.
,Threatening ...Nc4 and meanwhile defending f7 but this second move with this N delays Black's completion of his development just too long.
,! By attacking the fianchettoed B before Black has castled, I severely inhibit his completion of his development.
,There is no safe way for Black to chase this Q away, so he just has to carry on attacking, but without his key black-squared B.
,Threatening to capture on b2, thereby ruining White's queenside before he can castle. 
,Preferable to retreating the other N as the Nd4 would have been vulnerable to attack by ...e5, diverting the N from defence of c2.
,Threatening to win the c2 pawn after ...b4.
,?!  I knew I was walking into a fierce attack but believed I would be able to defend myself and then take advantage of the fact that Black's K was stuck in the middle, preventing his Rs from connecting.
,?!  I thought 18. ...Bf5 would have won, because I didn't think I could defend c2 properly but in our brief chat after the game, Gary reckoned that I had a saving resource with Nd4 at the appropriate moment, but I can't see how that would have helped: eg not 18. ...Bf5 19. Nd4 Rxd4 20. Rxd4 Qxc2++ Nor 18. ...Bf5 19. Qe3 Bxc2 20. Nd4 Be4+ 21. Kd1 Rc1+ 22. Ke2 Rxh1 ...  Perhaps he'd seen something I haven't.
,Black patiently rearranges his attacking pieces while allowing me to complete my development by doubling my rooks
,I was glad to have the time to prevent ...Bf5.
,Everything seems to be holding but I'm wholly committed to defence now and my Q is still out on a limb.
,Not sure this achieves much ...

"in the old days, I always treated the French defense kind of brutal; at this point, I usually played exd5, exd5, c4?!

"Just like me, this is also ION's, ""Best by test.""  In all the games that I've played with him, as black, this is how he's opened.
,So, I stick with my usual, as well.
,This move, however, took me off guard.  As just like what I was learning with Ken in our second game, I'm now in unfamiliar territory.  The most common move 2.Nf3, but ION played this instead.  What's more is that I have not seen this played on only the second move.  So, this is already a taste of how intense openings can be.
,Knowing that, I stick with my usual.
,Surprisingly, he brings the other N out.  Well, I shouldn't be surprised as this develops.  But, the reason behind it is that I expected 2.Nf4.
,In case ION's plan is 4.Nb5, I prevent that.
,And, he plays an early K side fianchetto.
,So, I continue with my development.
,Not surprisingly, he completes that fianchetto.  But, nothing holds me back from continuing with my development, as I bring my other N into play.  It's also worth noting that I'm on the fringe between opening up a line for my Bf8 with an fianchetto, or advancing my e7 pawn.
,Meanwhile, this is how ION opens up a line for his Bc1.  I am not surprised as it's generally not wise to do a double fianchetto.  I have done that a couple of times but have, except for one or two occasions, gotten myself into trouble, that way.
,After some careful consideration on what to do with my Bf8, I decide to fianchetto.  The reason being is that I don't want to disturb the layout or structures of the Sicilian Defense.  By structures, I am talking about the pawn chain.  As I like the way my pawns are aligned and don't want to change it.  So, I felt that this move was the way to go.
,I have no idea why ION played this.
,But, like him earlier, I also complete my K side fianchetto.
,Bringing his K to safety, as expected.
,That's when I use the opportunity to pin.  And, now, I can see why ION played 3.Nbc3.  Before, exchanging the N would benefit me since the exchange involves his more powerful piece.  But, his Nc3, however, is just as powerful as his Ne2.  I didn't know that in the beginning, unfortunately.
,Hitting my B.  I didn't know what to do and had considered retreating.  I think this would've been the better option.
,?! On the other hand, I was worried that retreating would allow his Ne2 to become dangerous since the pin would be broken.  I asked myself a similar question to what Ken has told me to ask myself as well as others to ask myself.  That is, what would I do, if ION had the option of something like 10.Qd2, and then 11.f5, with the idea being 12.Nf4.  In other words, what would I do, if he could repost his N to that square, as then it would be dangerous.  By exchanging, I felt like I might have stopped a problem before it started.  Come to think, the N moving wasn't really of a concern, and therefore, I should not have given it too much thought.  Better would have been to retreat my LSB, as it was certainly not worth the exchange given that there's potential for his Nc3 to become as dangerous.  The point is that I might have been use my B at a later point in time, as Ken has mentioned.  I think that what really needs to be worked is exploring my options.  For had I done that, I thought about what those pieces could really do, I wouldn't have made this exchange.
,I also wanted time to castle.  But, this could have been just as soon by retreating.
,As now, just like me, ION has just completed his development.
,In case, ION is planning to make any threats against my c5 pawn, I add another defender.  The more important reason, though, is to discover an attack on his b2 pawn.

"Kind of naive from white's side, unless he purposedly wants to keep his B away from his Kside.

,Good for me. I should have gone Ng5 at once.

"Friedrich Saemisch (Charlottenburg, 20 settembre 1896 – Berlino, 16 agosto 1975), è stato uno scacchista tedesco.

Pur essendo stato un forte giocatore, vincitore di numerosi tornei, Friedrich Sämisch è noto soprattutto per aver dato il suo nome a due importanti varianti di apertura:
Alla difesa est indiana: 1. d4 Cf6 2. c4 g6 3. Cc3 Ag7 4. e4 d6 5. f3
Alla difesa Nimzowitsch: 1. d4 Cf6 2. c4 e6 3. Cc3 Ab4. 4. a3

Nel 1950 fu uno dei 27 giocatori che la FIDE nominò Grande maestro quando il titolo venne ufficialmente creato.

Nel torneo di Carlsbad del 1929 non ottenne una buona classifica, ma vinse il premio di bellezza per la partita contro Grünfeld. Nello stesso torneo vinse anche con José Raúl Capablanca. Il grande cubano fece una svista in apertura e perse un pezzo, ma anziché abbandonare, come avviene in questo caso nelle partite di alto livello, tentò di resistere. Lo svantaggio si dimostrò troppo grande anche per un giocatore della sua classe. Questa sconfitta costò a Capablanca il primo posto nel torneo (si classificò pari secondo a mezzo punto da Aaron Nimzowitsch).

Noi in questo forum cercheremo di scrutare più a fondo la variante della difesa est indiana

1. d4 Cf6
2. c4 g6
3. Cc3 Ag7
4. e4 d6
5. f3 (Il bianco consolida la struttura dei pedoni centrali, riservandosi di rispondere alla spinta del nero in e5 o c5 con la spinta in d5, assicurandosi una forte catena pedoni sulle case bianche. In questa variante, usualmente, il bianco arrocca lungo; contrariamente al normale sviluppo strategico della partita con arrocchi eterogenei e centro bloccato, qui il bianco e il nero possono condure l’attacco e il contrattacco anche sugli stessi settori sul quale arroccato il proprio Re. (fonte Porreca)
5. … O-O (Si può giocare anche subito 5. … e5, dato che in caso di 6. dxe, dxe; 7. Dxd8+ Rxd8; 8. Ag5 c6 ecc. il bainco non ottiene nulla.) 
Come scritto anche sulle informazioni di Gknot, scopriamo che dopo questa posizione, esistono diverse possibilità (sottovarianti)
6. e5 King's Indian (E85), Saemisch, variante ortodossa
6. b6 King's Indian (E82), Saemisch, double fianchetto variation
6. c6 King's Indian (E81), Saemisch, Byrne variation

Abbiamo un amico, Stefano (ircmancer) che è molto interessato a questa variante dell’est-indiana. Per lui, ed altri interessati apro questo forum sperando di fare cosa gradita.

A questo punto, continuando dalla 6° mossa del bianco Stefano ed io continuiamo questa partita cercando di seguire una sequenza di mosse più consona possibile alla variante Saemisch e commentando di volta in volta le mosse che giocheremo.

,Non ho un gioco irruento, pertanto cerco di non uscire molto dagli schemi dell' est-indiana.
D'altronde questa mossa è stata giocata da Kasparov e, per certi campioni, ho il massimo del rispetto anche se, in verità, ero tentato di giocare subito h6 per fermare le brutte intenzioni del cavallo di donna.
Mi aspetto d5 da parte del mio avversario che non penso sia intenzionato ad abbattere il centro che si è costruito.

,Mmmm... sono molto indeciso, tra due mosse.
- 7. d5, prevista da Klaus, blocca il centro, lasciandomi tempi per attaccare dal lato di re, ma lascia anche la diagonale libera per l'alfiere di re del nero, e mi impedisce la futura mossa Cd5, importante per far spostare il Cf6, baluardo difensivo del lato di re del nero.
- 7. Cge2, che in caso 7. ... cxd4 8. Cxd4 lascia il centro aperto, ma con i cavalli bianchi in posizione più aggressiva. Inoltre la diagonale è meno accessibile e Cd5 possibile.
Una nota per Klaus: secondo me 6. ... h6 è pericolosa, una volta che il bianco è tornato in e3 con l'alfiere e ha messo la donna in d2...

Beh, intanto ci ho pensato:

7. Cge2

,Mi ero preparato un commento per d5 del bianco, ma ho dovuto gettare tutto. 
,Oh... mi dispiace, Klaus, ma credo che l'imprevedibilità sia una delle tante qualità che, in equilibrio, creano lo scacchista 😊 Spero che renda interessante questa partita di studio!

Klaus dimostra coraggio (altra qualità importante), con Db6 crea pressione e diversivo sul lato di donna, e mi mette in pensiero per il mio progetto di arroccare lungo, e per la possibile pressione su d4. In compenso, allontana la regina dal lato di re.
Inoltre, c'è il pedone al sarin in b2, sacrificandolo, allontanerei ulteriormente la regina nera dall'azione, ma direi addio all'arrocco lungo.
Potrei mettermi a caccia della regina con Ch4, e alla fine della variante avrei i cavalli in buona posizione sul lato di donna, ma vorrebbe dire posporre l'attacco dal lato opposto. In generale, cerco sempre di stare nel piano originale, a meno di un'ottima occasione.

In sunto, mi accontento del leggero vantaggio di avere la regina nera allontanata temporaneamente, tolgo il vetriolo da b2, e proseguo con il piano originale, preparandomi all'eventuale bufera su d4:

8. Qd2 

,on devi preoccuparti Stefano. Anzi, apprezzo moltissimo l'imprevedibilità e la fantasia dei miei avversari. Vedi ad esempio le mie partite con Aurelio, (jrcapatosta), un giocatore che, grazie a queste sue capacità non sono ancora riuscito a battere  
Devo riconoscere che queste attitudini non brillano nel mio curriculum. Il mio gioco, anche se sufficientemente preciso, il mio amico-insegnante di scacchi Paco, lo definisce ""schifosamente matematico"", manca di quel tocco di fantasia in grado di vincere una partita per merito e non, come mi succede spesso, per gli errori del mio avversario.
Dopo questa piccola confessione, proseguiamo con la nostra partita.
Penso che dopo aver posizionato la mia Donna in b6, posso permettermi di cercare di indebolire il tuo centro. I pedoni in linea sono estremamente ostici da abbattere, meglio farlo subito.
Penso che prima di occuparti del pedone in d4, andrai a eliminare il mio cavallo in f6 per proseguire cercando di minacciare la mia donna con il tuo cavallo (Cd5). Sono comunque supposizioni.
Considero la mia struttura, dopo le suindicate mosse un po' più solida di quella di Stefano. Tutto dipenderà dal suo arrocco, probabilmente lungo. Lasciamoci sorprendere  

,Ho esaminato attentamente la 'variante Klaus', e in sostanza si finisce con pedoni doppiati in colonna f e un pedone isolato in d... una buona struttura (per il bianco 😄) nel finale, con il re nelle catacombe, e il re nel finale deve essere in prima linea come Harold nella battaglia di Hastings (wikipediatelo per vedere com'è andata a finire...).
Eppure non mi convince, non saprei che piano adottare nel frattempo (l'attacco dal lato di re non va, con tre pedoni contro quattro) e non mi piace, oltre che essere poco salutare, aspettare e scambiare.
Preferisco stare sul semplice. Dopo Cxd4, mi aspetto Cf6, e portando il cavallo in b3 potrò, Klaus permettendo, fare il sospirato arrocco lungo e iniziare l'attacco dal lato di re. La posizione dei cavalli è simile a quella che si raggiunge nell'English Attack della Najdorf: sembrano fuori dai giochi, ma in due balzi...

9. Cxd4 

,Mi lascio contagiare dalla voglia di innovazioni. Forzo il gioco e vediamo come va a finire.
La combinazione è lunga e tutto dipende dalle intenzioni del mio avversario. Gioco Cxe4. 
Presumo che la continuazione sarà la seguente. Oltre non voglio rischiare di buttarmi nell'analisi.

09. ... Cxe4
10. fxCe4 DxCd4
11. Axe7 Te8
12. Dxd4 Axd4
13. Axd6 Axc3+
14. bxc3

Dopo questa combinazione, se va in porto, come potrete tutti notare se la visualizzate sulla vostra scacchiera, la struttura del bianco è molto ""bucherellata"" e mi trovo, anche se materialmente con un pedone in meno, avantaggiato nella struttura del gioco. Prima comunque vediamo come risponde Stefano. 
,o esaminato furiosamente la situazione e le varianti 🤔🤔🤔 e sono giunto alle seguenti conclusioni:
- la 'variante Klaus' è brutta brutta per me, il nero recupera il pedone (Txe4) nella mossa successiva, e poi mi trovo pedoni doppiati e isolati in colonna c... praticamente carne da torre.
- mi è sembrato di intravedere una soluzione che mi permetterebbe di evitare i pedoni doppiati, ma le varianti possibili sono tante... meglio giocare una mossa alla volta. Comunque la butto giù per reciprocità: fxe4 Dxd4; Axe7 Te8; Axd6 Dxd2+; Rxd2 Axc3+; Rxc3 Txe4
- per adesso devo prendere il maledetto cavallo kamikaze, e lo faccio perché se prendessi con il cavallo rischierei che Te8 me lo inchiodasse al re e poi il nero gioca f5...

dunque per ora:
10. fxe4 

,Seguo le indicazioni scritte nella nota della mia 9. mossa.

Al momento non voglio uscire dallo schema prefisso. Con leggero sadismo noto che ho scompaginato i piani iniziali di Stefano. Generalmente esco poco dalle mosse di base di un'apertura, ma questa volta, a quanto pare, cambiarle si è volto a mio favore.

Per vincere non bisogna giocare solo bene, in questo modo tutte le partite finirebbero patte, ma indurre l'avversario ad un errore o uno sbandamento della struttura e profittarne.
Logicamente con Stefano non siamo ancora arrivati a questo punto.

Una valutazione complessiva, al momento, concede al nero quel leggerissimo vantaggio che questa apertura da. Il bianco, ha si costruito un centro ampio ma solido sostenuto dal Pf3, ma il nero ha la possibilità di sfruttare il leggero ritardo di sviluppo causato dalle molte spinte di pedoni del bianco.

,Black cannot play Bg4 and pin the knight .

,The b2 pawn ...Can Black get more forces to atack on this 
I had to chose between Rb1 and Ra2.
On Rb1 , black may play Qf5 ?

"Thankfully he misses that, but this is still strong.

,So one pawn goes.
,Counter-attacking rook and knight.

,Has my king finally found a safe square?
,Another pawn goes.
,But my pieces are coming to life.
,He forks my rooks.
,I attack h2. OK stop and find white's best move.
,Instead of this, he could have won with 30. Rxh7+. After the game we were looking at this, and he was following it up with, after Kxh7, 31. Qh3+ but then black has Nh6 defending. The correct follow up, which was pointed out to me later was 31. Qb7+. Now 31... Kh8 or g8 leads to 32. Qg7 mate, and if 31...Kh6 then 32. Qg7+ Kh5 33. Qh7+ Nh6 34. g2-g4+ and white is mating (Kxg4 35 Qxg6+ or Kh4 35. Qxh6+).
That means after 31. Qb7+ black has to block on d7, after which white simply exchanges on d7 and then plays Nxf8, forking King on h7 and whichever piece black has on d7, and ends a rook and pawn up. Luckily, my opponent missed that and allowed me to play....

,[!] Excellent attacking move!  Now it's all on.
,[!!/?]  Two exclams for courage; the query because, sadly, it is not the best or safest.  Instead, 22.Qf3 would have stopped Black's K-side attack.  But you just have to admire this move!  (And what a position!)
,[!] Of course 22...Rxa8?? led to a very swift quietus!

,How else to stop the mate?  There is nothing.  White is now in serious trouble once more.
,[!] 
,[!?] A slight reprieve for White!  Black could have closed out the game with this: 25...e4!! This move closes off several escape routes for the King, and threatens 26...Qh4ch  27.Kg1 Qh2ch 28.Kf1 Qh1ch 29.Ke2 Qxg2ch 30.Ke1 Qf2#.

Having said all that, and in view of the threat associated with the text move, 25...e4 would not have been easy to find.
,[?]  This looks very dangerous - one feels there ought to be a mate in here somewhere, so confined is the White king.  Much safer was 26.Qf3, protecting the rook.
,Good; but ...e4 would still have been effective.  
,[?!] Threatens mate in one, but White can still wriggle clear.  Best was still 27...e4!, but very nearly as strong would have been 27...Qh5! (I think I would have gone for this line, actually) 28.Kg3 Ng4! 29.Rf1 g5! with the idea 30...Qh4ch and 31...Nh2ch, winning the f1-rook; or, if the rook vacates f1, possibly ...Qf2ch.
,[!] Trying a different tack.
,[?] this ought to have led to a quick loss.  White simply had to take the knight, whatever else happened, e.g.: 30.gxh3! Qxe1ch 31.Kh2 Qxc1 and White is busted, but he is not yet checkmated.  
,[?!]  Should a move that wins be counted as a bad move because there existed a move that won more quickly?  Black is still winning from here, naturally, but he could have closed the game out at once by 32...Ne2! and mates in 5.
,[!?] 33...Ne2!
,[!] Threat: ...Qh6#.
,[!]  Desperation, of course, but still fighting hard.  This is an excellent defence in an almost hopeless position, offering Black some attractive ways of going wrong.
,Material parity is restored, but is White back on level terms?
,[??]  He is now!  Better than level terms in fact!  Black still had a winning advantage after the check, but had to find this exciting line: 36...Be8!  37.Qd6ch! Kg8  38.Rxf7! Qg1ch! (The rook can not be taken, on account of 38...Bxf7 39.Qd8ch and White wins!) 39.Kh3 Qh1ch 40.Kg4 Qxg2ch 41.Kf5 Nd4ch! 42.Kxe5  Nc6ch 43.Kf5 Qg6ch 44.Qxg6  hxg6ch 45.Kxg6 Bxf7ch and wins.

"I start with my usual.
,Jack: Siciliano.  Joe: I like it!  Jack: You like it?  Let's see how it goes?  When he said that, Jack might of thought that he was taking me off guard since it appears like something different.  I say that because even though this mentor taught me the defense, he hasn't played it in a while.  So, my guess is that by saying it, Jack's reminding me of how intense openings can be.  However, I am very used to it, as that is the main defense that I play.  So, for now, everything is not only standard, but it's what I'm most used to.
,That is, until now as 5...a6 is the most common move, in this position.  The idea being to, as we know, prevent 6.Nb5 or 6.Bb5+.  But, this move is just as effective, and this, in reality, where I'm reminded of how intense openings can be.  It used to be, even after my second training game with Ken, that I went wrong by not knowing what to do when someone played something against me that I'm not used to.  That was, especially in the opening when entering unfamiliar territory.  Yes, the second training game with Ken was very helpful as he is also a good coach.  However, unlike what you'd think, it did not solve the problem.  Overtime, I learned, even though it might not be the right attitude to just expect the unexpected.  I learned that if I'm prepared for anything expect to be surprised, unfamiliar openings or moves will not take me off guard.  Therefore, I'd know how to handle.  For example, the Spanish opening starts off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5.  However, we can see a similar setup in the Sicilian.  For example, Jack and other's have also played 5...Nc6.  This used to take me off guard and, back in the day, caused me to go wrong.  However, I calmly play 6.Bb5 as that gets me back into familiar territory.  When, it does not work in that position, I find something similar to make it work.  But, the idea is to just stay calm and collected and pretend that it's yoga.  That is how I adjust to something I'm not used to.  It's the analogy that I have created to compare yoga to chess when getting into something that intense.  The journey is to yoga as the position is to chess.  Just like with yoga that takes you on the journey, in chess, every position is different.  Some intense.  But, we don't fight or run away from it (which is what the Fight or Flight Syndrome is.)  Instead, we accept it for what it is and learn to adjust.
,With that being said, I just go back to where the N originally was.  This is also just like Yoga.  It would be like you're supposed to do the balance.  But, you lose it.  How do you handle it?  Well, you don't struggle to keep the foot up.  Instead, you just put the foot on the floor.  And, when you're in standing facing dog and lunge, you don't struggle to get the foot on the mat.  Instead, if it doesn't make it on it's own, you help it to get there with your hand.  Well, the same thing here.  I wanted to do a lot with the N.  But, I couldn't find any squares.  The only thing I thought might be logical was 6.Nf5 but am not ready to exchange.  Therefore, I just returned the N to where it originally was.  And, it's worth noting that the loss of tempo here is of no concern to me.
,The downside is the pin.  Of course, I'm used to seeing it.
,I did consider 7.Be2, but I felt that if Jack could pin, it was safe for me to pin, as well.  When he breaks it...
,I break it, as well.
,Not surprisingly, Jack develops.
,So, I directly pin.  Worth noting that even though I'm calm and collected, the one thing that doesn't work is becoming too happy about the position, as I remember with Ken combined with other games.  There was one where being too happy lost the game, at once, as that's when I let my guard down.
,As anticipated, Jack castles.
,But, so do I.
,Attacking my B.  But, given that my N is pinned, Jack will force an exchange.
,This was played to prevent the loss of material.  Not only was the B attacked, but on top of being pinned, my Nf3 had 2 attackers against only 1 defender.  So, I defended again to match the equation.  However, my original play was 11.Nd5?? which would've been a disaster.  And, that's where the coaching began.  Jack: 11.Nd5?? loses immediately.  I then told him that there was a variation where I'd capture material.  And, he said, ""Even if you were to capture, I'd get a piece without compensation. 
,This is where Jack prevents 13.Nb5.
,Doesn't bother me the least bit, as I break the pin.  The only downside is that Jack exchanges before I'm ready.  As I like where my Nf3 was placed.  But, my guess is that Jack didn't want me to do anything else with the N which is why he took.  Despite not being ready, I also kept in mind that he may exchange, with which, I take back with the Q and maintain a strong position.
,The idea is keeping my other N tied down.  The idea is, in general, if I move it, the c pawn will fall.  In fact, that's what Jack mentions while coaching me, which we'll see soon.  Not knowing what else to do it, unlike a couple of moves earlier, I am now ready to exchange.  So, I go for it.  In part, I didn't know what else to do.  And, in general, when I'm not sure, the way to not be taken off guard is going by what my instincts tell me without giving it a lot of consideration.  The reason is because thinking about me too much has also generated the Fight or Flight mechanism, in the past, which is also where I'd go wrong.  In fact, that's one reason that it took me a long while to surpass beginner status, let alone, where I am today.    That's why I give the absolute threshold (just enough) consideration to ask myself the chances that it will work.  But, if it is possible, I do it.  More often then not, it's exchanging, as I feel more comfortable doing so.  As for me, it is about getting rid of my opponents pieces, especially when they look strong.  But, that's especially in this context as I was going by GM Susan Polgar's general advice to exchange N for B.  Well, that's exactly what happened here. 
,As that gives me enough time to defend the c pawn again.  However, this move was also possible.  But, as noted, I exchanged because it looked beneficial, since we're talking about N for B.  If it was the B, instead, I would not have done that.  Before this move, my original play was, once again 16.Nd5 with the same idea.  This time, it was being that one of my pieces wasn't en-prise.   This is where, like with Ken, Mr. Stockel gets into my thought process and coaches me.  Jack: Why did I play 14...Rc8  Joe: I'm not sure because my Nc3 is protected.  Jack: It's because I knew that you would play Nd5 with which your c2 pawn is unprotected.  So, it's up to you.  Well, that led me to making the right choice because it is certainly not worth a pawn.  With stronger players, it's generally not a piece, but rather, a pawn that makes or breaks the game as this mentor has emphasized.  Therefore, I play this, to allow my Nc3 to move since it is now defended again.
,However, I overlooked this move, as the c pawn was attacked.  So, in this case, it was almost counterproductive for getting rid of the half pinned.  Nonetheless, I will find a way around this, sooner or later.  
,First, I protect.
,Once Jack plays this, I exchange Q's.  In this context, however, I would've declined.  But, the idea behind it is that in the aftermath, I am going to win a pawn.  That is the most important thing on my mind because it was too often that I have missed the opportunity to win material against my coach.  The reason being is because of what Ken mentioned in a previous annotation.  As it turns out, I have trusted Jack too much to make good moves which is how I've overlooked his bad moves.  However, that's why I remember not to trust my opponent.  And, by not doing it here I catch his error and take advantage with this variation that will leave me a pawn up.

,In effetti io non avevo intenzione di giocare 11. ... Cxd4, mossa che trovo prematura e strategicamente pericolosa. Difatti tu, oltre a Ce2 da non trascurare, potresti giocare, dopo b4 e c5, Cxd5 riguadagnando il pedone in tutta tranquillità. Perciò se mai prima giocherei e6. La variante l'ho presentata per scopo didattico, infatti ha sollevato un certo interesse 😉

Sono d'accordo con la sequenza di mosse fino a 11. Af2. Adesso ci rifletto un attimo, poi ti scrivo la mia mossa 11. .
.
Preferisco continuare lo sviluppo, consolidare la struttura dei pedoni, preparare Af8 che mi consentirà di spostare l'alfiere sui due lati. Come detto in precedenza, sarà una partita strategica e posizionale. Il cavallo in f5, in tal senso, controlla più che minacciare.

Ora Klaus si trova, secondo me, in seri dubbi: Ad3 è una buona mossa di sviluppo e minaccia il mio wondercavallo, ma toglie la casella d3 alla regina, e allora potrei davvero decidere di prendere il pedone d4; Ce2 permette l'ottima mossa c3, ma allontana un altro difensore dal lato di donna; Ca4 perde inutilmente un tempo dopo Db4+; g4 finisce con scambio di torri e regina bianca in castigo in h1... nelle partite posizionali, si dedica molta energia a minare il possibile gioco dell'avversario. 
,.Un buon insegnamento negli scacchi è quello di far si che le convinzioni del proprio avversario comincino a traballare per qualche insicurezza. La parola minare, come ben tutti sapiamo, in questo caso vuole infatti significare rendere insicura la struttura che l'avversario si era proposto di creare per rendere incisivo un suo attacco in un certo lato, generalmente dove si trova il re o il più debole, della scacchiera.
Ho l'impressione che Stefano stia cercando di fuorviarmi, tipo Quinto Fabio Massimo Verrucoso detto il Temporeggiatore, con continue, ma non incisive minacce nel lato di Re, mentre nel lato di donna cerca di creare una solida base per iniziare da questo lato la vera battaglia. Forse mi sbaglio, ma non voglio lasciarmi sorprendere troppo.
Muovo b4. Stefano cercherà di rinforzare la diagonale nella quale è andata a piazzarsi il mio pedone arretrando il suo Alfiere in f8, ma io insisterò nella mia idea di far demordere la sua iniziativa obbligando la sua donna ad andarsene dalla verticale b muovendo il mio cavallo in a4.
A questo punto molte velleità si spegneranno

,.
,In questa situazione, mi trovo ad un bivio strategico importante. Da una parte c'è un sentiero tranquillo, dall'altra una mulattiera tra i dirupi. Il sentiero tranquillo corrisponde alla mossa Cg7: il cavallo torna indietro solo temporaneamente, perché potrà tornare in f5, sia che il bianco muova g5, che g4xh5 (a cui seguirebbe Txh5). Se invece il bianco non prende ne avanza con il pedone g4, allora mi si crea qualche imbarazzo (ad esempio Ad3). h5xg4 porta allo scambio di torri menzionato in seguito, con il cavallo posizionato un po' peggio.
La strada impervia è quella tracciata da Klaus come sconveniente per il nero. In realtà il giudizio di Klaus mi lascia perplesso; infatti dopo lo scambio di torri seguito da Dxh1 Ch6, supponendo che il bianco voglia aprirsi subito la colonna h con g5 seguito da Cf5, ecco che la donna è libera di scorrazzare per la colonna h, ma... a fare che? Il re nero potrebbe essere minacciato solo dall'intervento a supporto della torre, o dell’alfiere camposcuro, che sono molto laboriosi; la regina da sola non può fare granché, perché io non ho intenzione di arroccare; il mio alfiere è bloccato, ma la regina Bianca è lontanissima dall'azione, e nel cambio ci guadagno. Al bianco conviene, quasi quasi, Dh3, per posizionarsi sulla riga libera, ma se la regina dovesse intervenire sul lato di donna, il pedone g è in presa. Meglio allora Dh4, che però non minaccia nulla.
Io ho deciso: strada impervia. 14. g4 hxg4 15. hxg4 Txh1 16. Dxh1 Ch6.

,Poiché sappiamo tutti che il numero delle partite in 40 mosse che si possono inventare è stato calcolato essere pari a 25 moltiplicato 10 elevato alla centoquindicesima, il che è di gran lunga superiore al numero di elettroni che popolano l’universo: 10 elevato alla settantanovesima, avevo solo l'imbarazzo della scelta di cosa muovere...  
Naturalmente scherzo   Rispetto il modo di vedere del mio avversario e forse ha ragione.
Ora l'unico problema, considerata la calma sulla scacchiera è quello di difendere il Pg dall'attacco del cavallo. Ho deciso di difenderlo con l'alfiere. La mia donna al momento mi va bene dove stà.
Ora aspetto che Stefano si decida a muove un pedone sul lato di donna. E' da un po' che l'aspetto questa mossa, già promessa per tener fede allo spirito di questa apertura. Resta ancora valida anche Ca6.
Lasciamoci sorprendere  
.
,Prima di tutto, complimenti al matematico che ha fatto questo calcolo, mi piacerebbe stringergli la mano. Sei stato tu, Klaus?

Ora che tocca a me, vedo che nel mio universo ci sono solo tre elettroni: a5, b5 e Ca6. Siccome voglio fare tutte e tre queste mosse, non resta che scegliere l'ordine, in modo che Klaus non me le possa impedire. O in modo che io stesso non me le impedisca; Ca6 impedisce a5, per esempio. Ci sono altre due mosse più sottili: b6 e Cd7. Soprattutto quest'ultima mi può tornare utile, seguite il mio ragionamento. Dopo b5, il cavallo bianco potrebbe andare in c5, rendendo possibile uno scambio di cavalli in a6 o in d7. Siccome il mio cavallo mi sembra più cruciale di quello di Klaus, per la mia manovra di attacco, non voglio questo scambio.
Perciò comincerei con a5, quale seguirebbe prevedibilmente a3 (b4xa5 manco a parlarne, c3 taglia la strada del ritorno al cavallo); poi seguirebbe Cd7, in modo da poter muovere Cb6 se il bianco muove Cd5 senza rischiare lo scambio, e poi poter spostare il cavallo in c4, casella dalla quale non può essere sloggiato se non sacrificando l'alfiere buono. Queste mosse di cavallo, avverranno prima o dopo b7-b5, a seconda dei casi.

Avevo detto b4xa5 manco a parlarne? Guardate questa variante:

… a5
bxa5 Dxa5+
Cc3 Ab4
Dxh6 Axc3+
Rf1 Dxa2
Dh8+ Rd7
Ah4 (a 1 dal matto!) Dxb1+

E il nero da’ scacco finché l’alfiere non torna in a5, unica mossa che salva il nero dal matto. Ma con una torre di vantaggio.

,Insegnamento: Si dice che la miglior difesa è l'attacco, ma ricordiamoci di Krojanty.

La carica di Krojanty o battaglia di Krojanty è stata una carica di cavalleria polacca durante la campagna di Polonia operata da parte delle truppe naziste impegnate nell'occupazione del territorio polacco, nella seconda guerra mondiale. La campagna (1º settembre 1939 – 5 ottobre 1939) è culminata con la resa delle ultime forze polacche, al termine della quale, dopo circa quattro settimane di combattimenti, ebbe inizio la seconda guerra mondiale. il 1º settembre a Krojanty il 18º reggimento di Ulani carica di sorpresa e disperde elementi del 76º reggimento di fanteria appartenente alla 20ª divisione motorizzata delle forze naziste.
Cavalleria polacca durante la battaglia del fiume Bzura

Durante l'invasione la cavalleria polacca effettuò un totale di 16 cariche nel tentativo di arrestare l'avanzata tedesca; qui i nazisti poterono sperimentare e mettere appunto la moderna tecnologia offerta dai carri armati, dagli aerei e dalle radiocomunicazioni, allo scopo di creare una nuova modalità di guerra caratterizzata dall'uso combinato di nuove forze di attacco. La campagna del 1939 rappresenta l'esempio dell'efficacia dell'informazione mediatica utilizzata per svolgere la propaganda riguardo l'efficienza delle proprie forze, oltre che allo scopo di screditare la capacità difensiva del nemico. Essa difatti fu il primo esempio del un nuovo metodo di condurre la guerra, per la quale gli strateghi di Berlino coniarono il termine ""Blitzkrieg"", (guerra lampo), dove le forze tedesche tentarono di annientare con azioni fulminee, l'esercito poco addestrato e male organizzato nemico.

questa era la continuazione proposta da Stefano, che, a suo dire, considerava la più logica e che accetto considerato che, dopo queste mosse, a mio avviso, si potrebbe considerare questa partita conclusa tanto è palese il vantaggio del bianco, molto difficile da recuperare.

La mia mossa è:

21. c4 e così facciamo traballare il centro del nero e metto pressione sul Re appostato in d8. Nemmeno la prossima Ab4+ con successiva 22. Rd1 scalfisce il mio vantaggio. Forse una esame approfondito di Stefano mi darà ragione, o no  ?

"Although my opponent is higher rated than me, I have won every game between us. Most of the time I get Black against Dusan and he's already tried both e4 and d4 against me, so this time, he opted for the English opening.
,I decided to avoid the four knights variation to confuse my opponent, though I do enjoy that line.
,Here, I'm not really threatening to capture the pawn, because of Qa4+. Developing one of the bishops would have been a more effective use of this tempo.
,Now I have to watch out for a potential knight sacrifice on c6 followed by Bxc6+ picking up the rook on a8
,White increases his control over the light squares.
,Here White loses his opening advantage after allowing Black to trade his undeveloped bishop for White's centralized knight.
,Threatening ... Qxc3 and ... Nxc4 winning a pawn
,Black must seize this chance to break through the center, else he will suffer if White is allowed to play e4, cramping Black's position.
,Nxe7+ first was a slight improvement for White.
,Black is up a pawn, has a 3-1 majority on the Queenside, but White has the bishop pair.
,White has the initiative here and it's unpleasant to defend as Black, thought the position is approximately equal.
,Exchanging rooks will ease the defensive task and additional exchanges will eventually lead to a winning endgame.
,... Nb5 first was also an option
,Attacking the pawn chain as in the French defence
,With the idea of an eventual Bc4
,Only move, else 31. h3 will be hard to meet
,Here ... Qf5 was the most accurate move, for reasons that I couldn't figure out during the game.
,In this position, White can secure a draw by perpetual with 35. Bf8! (threatening 36. Qh8 Qh7 37. Bxg7+ winning) Qh7 36. Qe6+ Qg6 37. Qg8
If the Black Queen were on f5 instead, he'd be able to defend with 35. ... Qd7 and White's attack runs out of steam.
,White's best try here is to trade Queens, kick the Knight with h3 and then play fxe5.
,Here Black's best move is ... Nf6, intending ... Qg6+

"I think that if he doesn't play f5 at once, this pawn will prove to be brave. 
,...here, the obvious one was f5... returning the initiative to him! Never!
,A little trick... to keep the game interesting. 
,The real scope of this manouver is to allow my own lsb into the game.
,If Qe4, Bg2 winning the d5 pawn. 
,!? This is a very doubled edge move. It blocks his own lsb's influence, while I can get to g2 any time I want, making it very active. The R will have to spend some move, but if black's Q or lsb want to move, they have to calculate the consecuences at any move. It seems that I'm getting released, but it's not true. A hidden threat is coming after black castles. And I won't castle queenside now, with all his pawns coming... no way. 
,Now, I felt I had the game in my hands. It's very easy to attack all those advanced pawns...
,On the agenda a triple attack on d5, but it won't succeed right now. 
,I'd say a bad choice. IF I played b3, then ok, but now?
,I'm not sure about Qf5... it was wery easy to kick, so I need more pressure. If Qa5, Qb6 and the Q's exchange slowens down my attack. 
,Well done, increasing pressure on the e column. Time to reinforce my own pressure...
,I know that if he moves his K away from the diagonal, d4 would become a strong move for black. But... which square should the BK go? Not so easy!...
,Good, controlling c5. But...
,What I am really threaten is... nothing. I'm just preventing him from playing his own attack, d4. Shall black do?
,No, he could't. I did. Now, it's mate in two. Can you see it? :-)

"Already, White is in violation of at least two 'principles'.  I've offered Black a free pawn, gratis and for nothing.  On top of that I have moved a pawn that does absolutely nothing to free White's pieces.  What's the story?  In common with other gambits, the King's Gambit gives away nothing for free.  What White gets - or hopes to get - in return is time, and more control of the centre than Black can obtain.   
,Declining the gambit in probably the most 'principled' manner.  The classic King's Gambit Declined goes 2...Bc5, which, in developing the bishop, interdicts the dark squares in White's field.  A real nuisance, that, as 3.fxe5?? in response involves White in a whole heap of trouble after 3...Qh5ch!  Objectively best is simply to take the pawn.  To set against the given up pawn, White will need quite substantive advantages in time and activity.  The 19th century American Master, Pollock, I think it was, used to decline the King's Gambit with the knight move.
,Transposing into a Vienna Gambit set-up.  Probably not the best (3.Nf3 seems preferable, as putting more pressure on Black) but quite playable, all the same.  
,[?]  Black clearly wants nothing whatever to do with the White f-pawn.  That's fair enough, but this pawn move does very little to progress Black.  It frees no pieces, nor develops any, nor does it add to Black's claim on the centre.  It does stop a White minor piece from landing on b5, but that is a very minor consideration that doesn't inconvenience White at all.  There are better things for White to do!
,Another piece deployed, and adding to White's claim on the centre.  I'm still unconcerned whether or not Black takes the f-pawn.  After 4...exf4?! 5.d4 would suit me very well.
,[!] Now this pawn move is OK - probably Black's best available move in fact.  It consolidates the grip Black has on her share of the centre, and frees the light-square bishop (LSB).  True, it shuts in the other bishop, but it will be happy enough, defensively placed on e7.
,Developing, and striking at the f7-square.  White wants to step up the pressure on Black's game.  When White castles, the King's rook will at ance be ready to attack down the f-file.
,[!?] In keeping with development.  However, I would probably have found ...Bg4 more inconvenient.  Even so, you will notice I made no effort to prevent such a move.  I could then immediately, or a little later, have hit the bishop by h2-h3, and asked the bishop whether it wanted to exchange itself for the knight, or go elsewhere...
,[!?] Totally unexpected, this is one of those moves that can really disrupt one's programme.  The upsides for Black is that it's a forcing move: where is the c4-bishop to go?  It loses no time, therefore, and does go some way to Black's development by offering her LSB a choice of directions to go. It also has some - a little - impact on the centre. There are downsides, though.  It is Black's fourth pawn move, and the LSB doesn't really need the extra mobility.  The light squares in Black's Q-side might prove interesting for White, and Black really ought to be looking at mobilising her bishops.  This is not a bad move, but it had the psychological effect of encouraging an ill-advised follow-up by Black.
,Still focused on the f7-square.
,[?] Now, short range, easily parried threats like are often criticised as being a waste of time.  But in fact they can be - and ought be - a means to an end.  Forcing as they are, they can help with seizing the initiative, or be the means by which one makes progress.  However, this Q-side expansion is rather premature, and ought to have waited upon the bishops being brought into the board.  Moves like 7...Bg4 or ...Be7 were much to be preferred.  Also good would have been 7...Na4 (!?), even though it moved a knight already moved, to the edge of the board, as it would pretty much have forced White to permit the exchange of his best piece.

,If one is forced to move a piece twice in the opening, let it be (if possible) to a more active square.  Black dare not exchange knights, because 8...Nxd5 9.Bxd5 10.Bd7 (say) ...Ng5 and White just about has a winning game already, with threats against f7 and the pin on the c6-knight.  Nor does 8...Nxe4 look healthy after 9.d4, and threats to open up the centre files for White's heavy pieces.   As it happens, 8.Ng5!? would gave been quite playable here.  After 8.Ng5 bxc3 (8....Bg4 is worth a look for Black) 9.Nxf7 cxd2 10.Qxd2 Qd7  11.Nxh8 White would have a big edge.
,[?] Black is moving pieces to some purpose, but here the course taken is leading to a blind alley.  Development of her unmoved pieces has become a matter of extreme urgency, as will shortly be shown. Much better would have been 8...Be7, which is at least solid.  Even a move like 8...Bg4 (?) has now become too dangerous for Black: 8...Bg4 9.Nxf6ch Qxf6? [So parlous has the situation become that ...gxf6 is actually safer, here] 10.Bd5 Bd7 11.fxe4 dxe4  12.d4 with enormous pressure in the centre (12...exd4? 13.Ng5).
,[?]  Not the best!  The plan here was to open up the f-file for the rook, and thereby bring a crossfire from the bishop and rook onto f7.  In fact White has overlooked a much stronger move: 9.Ng5!  The line is fairly complicated, so I'll just give a sample: 9.Ng5 Be6  10.Nxe6 fxe6 11.Ba4 ... (Also winning is 11.Nxf6ch) 11...exd5 12.Bxc6ch Ke7  13.exd5! ... (much stronger than grabbing the rook, on account of all the lines being opened up!) 13...Ra6 14.fxe5 dxe5 15.Qe2 ...  
,Safer would have been 9...gxf6, when White still have had the work to do to crack open the centre.
,Probably even stronger was 10.Bd5.  White has exactly the opposite problem from Black's here.  Thrown onto the defensive, Black has to play accurately to survive.  White is spoilt for choice, with several plausible ways to proceed.  He doesn't always pick the best!
,No better was 10...dxe5 11.Nd4! Qd6  12.Nxc6 Qxc6 13.Bxf7ch Kd8  14.d4 ... with a powerful attack against the King stuck in the centre of the board.  The sapient reader will have observed that White is in no all fired hurry (now) to complete his own development.  The reason is simple.  Right now White has ample resources to mount an attack sufficient to gain a decisive advantage.  To spend time completing White's development now, would enable Black to push hers along as well, and an opportunity might well be lost.  Principles and guidelines are all very well, but always they must be applied according to what is actually happening on the board.
,Opening up the file.  Now the bishop and rook both are aiming at f7.  Black's response is, of course, forced.
,A useful intermezzo, or 'zwischenzug'.  The Queen has to move again, the DSB is freed to move, and White STILL can play BxPch next move.
,Black's best defence, by the look.  Black had but one other square available for the Queen, but that would have invited this horror: 12...Qe7  13.Rxf7! Qd8  14.Qh5! g6  15.Qd5 Ra6  16.Rg7!! ... To stop the mate Black would at least have had to give up her queen.

"I am still following the opening database.
,He regains the pawn.
,I attack the bishop.
,The Bishop retreats. 
,I finally develop my last minor piece. 
,This is a mistake. This same mistake was made in Colin, Vincent (2396) vs. Mercier, Jean Loup (2056). It seems to me that this move just drops a pawn, and although black can regain it, white has an initiative. However, Gameknot post-match analysis surprisingly doesn't give it as a mistake. Anyway, stop and find white's best move now.
,Did you find it. This is as played in Colin, Vincent (2396) vs. Mercier, Jean Loup (2056), which continued with Ne5 15. Bd3 Nxd3 16. Rxd3 Bb7 17. h3 Rad8 18. Rc1	Qb8 19. e4	Nh5 20. Rdd1 Nf4 21. Qe3 Ng6 22.	Ne2	Qa8 23. Rd4 Ne5 1-0
Gameknot computer reckons Ne5 15. Rac1 Nxf3+ 16. Qxf3 Bxh2+ 17. Kh1 Bb7 18. Nd5 Bxd5 19. Rxd5 Nxd5 20. Rxc7 Bxc7 21. Bd3 Rfd8 22. Qe4 g6 is the best continuation for both sides.
,My opponent follows a different path. I am thinking for myself now!
,So I decide to regain the sacrificed material.
,With this move, black at least gets a pawn for the bishop. If he did the obvious move, which is to move his attacked queen, he is simply a pawn down.
,So I recapture the bishop.
,This is a losing mistake. Gameknot reckons best for black is  Qe7 17. Qf3 Nd5 18. e4 Nf6 19. Rac1 Ra6 20. Bxf6 Qxf6 21. Qxf6 gxf6 22. Nc7 Rb6 23. Ng4 Kg7 with advantage to white. OK stop and find black's best move.
,Did you find it? The problem for black is that 17.... Bxb5 is met with 18. Qg4! with a mating attack, as 18.....g6 is met with 19. Qg5 (threat 20. Qh6 and 21. Qg7 mate). 19....Ne7 seems black's best in order to meet 20. Qh6 with Nf5, but then g4 renews white's threats and black's position is resign-able.
Gameknot gives black's best defence as  Ne5 18. Nxc7 Bxe2 19. Bxe5 Rxa3 20. Rxa3 Bxd1 21. Bc3 g6 22. Ra2 Bb3 23. Ng4 Rd8 24. Ra7 Kf8 25. Kh2 but still with a huge advantage to white.
My opponent goes down another path.

,The problem with this move is that it allows a queen check, which means I can take his queen without losing my own.
,I check.
,Forced!
,His queen has been lost and his position is hopeless. He resigned. Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system, to let me know how I am getting on. Until next time dear reader!

"? But, I go right after his b pawn with the idea of threatening mate afterwards.  What I did not know is that Charles does not have a problem.  And, what I'm thinking is what's about to unfold which will prove disaster.  For starters, if I'm to prevent that, I'm gonna have to give up another pawn.  Much better would've been 24...Rxe3 which also threatens mate.  But, after 35.fxe3, all I could hope for is that white blunders and allows a stalemate.  
,?? I, deliberately, left my Q en-prise and took his b pawn, immediately.  This is because I did some studies with GM's Judit and Susan Polgar.  They involved back ranks that were weak in a similar way.  And, the HW question involved giving up the Q with the idea that if the opponent takes, it's mate, similar to this.  In the aftermath, I looked at reversion's game against dipole_moment.  There was a very similar threat but not including a Q sac.  Instead, reversion played 26...Qxe5, but had he recaptured with the R (26...Rxe5), dipole_moment would've had a mate in 4, involving the back rank, as well.  So, I thought that it would work here being that if he takes here, it's mate in 3.  However, I knew that Charles would see this threat.  However, I thought it would be very difficult for him drive it off without losing his Q, but I was wrong.  As it turns out, I overlooked the intermediate checks that are about to follow.  Instead, much better would've still been threatening mate and trying for a stalemate with 25...Rxe3.  Surely, Charles wouldn't have allowed it, but it would've been difficult for white to be able to avoid the draw.  In other words, it would've been difficult for him to win.  However, this move makes it easy.  The reason being is that I'm going to lose my Q with the intermediate checks, afterall.
,I would have resigned after 29.Rxd7!  But, I still had the back rank threat.
,Not surprisingly, Charles, stopped it here.
,So, I come out with one last threat.
,This is one of the moves that I had anticipated.
,So, I continue with Hope Chess in my last attempt.  But, it's in 2 phases.  The first plan was moving the f rook to c2. In other words 36...Rfc2. The idea behind this would be to allow 37...Rc1+ which is a forced mate as 38.Rd1 is forced, and then comes 38...Rxd1#   I knew that this wasn't going to work.  So, I analyzed a second variation which would result in a draw by repetition. This would involve preventing 36...Rfc2 with 36.Rd1 After which, I'd play 36...Rxh2  As then, I thought 37.Kf1 to prevent the checks. But, I would, however, answer with 37...Rbe2 followed by 38...Ref2 After that, though, I'd check starting with 39...Rhg2+, forcing 40.Kh1 and then 40...Rgh2+, 41.Kg1 And, that position would repeat itself until Charles and I have reached a draw by repetition.  Unlike the other plan, I thought that this one was going.  In other words, I thought that I'd be able to force a draw.
,That was, until this move.  Afterwhich, I realized that all of my hopes, that I mentioned earlier are gone.  At first, I thought that I could get out of this mess with 36...Ka4, but then 37.Rxa6# is checkmate.  Therefore, interposing with 36...Rb5 is forced.  And, after 37.Qxb5+, I'm forced to recapture.  No matter which way I take back, Charles would answer with 38.Kxf7.  The end result is that I'm left with only my K and 2 bad pawns (isolated pawns) against 5 pawns (2 of which are passed pawns) against his R.  So, I resigned here.

"As I look over this position the computer prefers the other move I was considering. 13. Rfe1. One problem that I have with these positions is that sometimes I overplay the position and do something too quickly. This is not a mistake, as white still has a great advantage, but just continuing to build pressure is often the better way to play. In my opinion knowing when to win back material and when to continue to build pressure in strong positions is one of the hardest skills to learn in chess. Here I went for this because I saw a forcing line where I thought I was winning and wasn't sure if black had counterplay if I waited. So I didn't wait. Fine, but not strictly speaking correct. 
,If any other move either rook to e1 with check is winning on the spot. If you leave the queen there of course you just take it. Just for example 13.. Qf6 14. Rfe1+ Ke8 (14..Kf8 and mate in 9) 15. Bd5 (another very strong slow play sort of move) and white is breaking through with rook coming to the d-file and the black king without room to move. There are some nice moves white has to find, but it looks very dangerous. 
,Now Rfe1. Still very strong here, but not quite as strong as the previous move. 
,I thought black had to play Be6 to try to hold everything together. I was looking at Nd4 (engine tells me this is better but not winning) or Bd5(engine tells me white is much better) or maybe just taking on e6 and trying to deflect the black queen away and taking on b7 (this is apparently winning, but I hadn't seen the line yet. For your enjoyment: 14..Be6 15. Bxe6 fxe6 16. Bxd6! (the move I hadn't yet seen) Qxd6 17. Qxb7 Rook moves somewhere 18. Qxg7 and white is winning the house. 

Instead black played this and is giving up the queen. I think if black wanted to try this they can probably resign. Perhaps this is a reasonable try though to trade the queen for some breathing space and hope for a blunder by white. 
,How bad is this postition for black? you might ask. Well it's so bad that the computer suggests the best possible move for white does NOT EVEN involve taking the queen with check. No human is ever doing that...at least I am not. This is winning. Apparently Qb3 is winning harder. 
,Maybe black can even castle this game...that would be a surprise. 
,And white is up the queen. This game is done. 
,Black should castle here if they want to have a shot to create some fortress. 
,Look at move 9. Same battery that started it finishes black off. 
,And dead. I hope this game was as enjoyable for you as it was for me. A little trip down the Evan's gambit. I have some other games in this line I will be showing to you all soon, so if this is a thing you are interested in come and look in a while to see. This one went very well for white and I was winning as soon as move 11, an opening win. Even still I could have played more precisely and I am trying to get a feel of when slowplaying is good and when I need to go in for the kill. Thanks for reading and hopefully we can keep learning together.

"Which allows Jeremy to win back a pawn by attacking again.
,Although seemingly easy to deal with, this is where the position becomes impossible for Charles to defend because of what's about to happen.  And, that is why I believe that it would've been better to exchange Knights on move 10.  As it turns out, the same piece is launching a devastating attack.
,And, that is due to this discovered check.  With it, Charles resigned.  At first, I was wondering why.  But, it turns out that, black is going to lose a piece without compensation.  At best, it'll be the Bishop.  He also might wind up losing the Rook.  But, against a strong player, not always, but usually, after losing a piece, you don't stand a chance.  Keeping that in mind, Charles, just like any other strong player wouldn't want to deal with that situation.

,So, I check here.
,And, this is how Jack gets out of it.  But, right after that combined with me being out of time (as I must get ready for work) we both agreed on a draw.  In the aftermath, we studied the variations together, and it turns out that this is, certainly, a draw.  If it had continued, I would've gone after Jack's pawn again with 63.Rh4.  Likewise, he would've defended again with 63...Kg2.  So, I'd recheck with 64.Rg4+.  And, those moves would repeat themselves and become a draw by repetition.  But, Jack said that the other way to draw would be if I did not go back and forth.  Therefore, it's what else would happen after 63.Rh4 Kg2.  In this case, 64.Nxe5 fxe5 65.Rxh2 Kxh2 66.Ke4 which allows 67.Kxe5  After which, it is a dead position which is also a draw as we're only left with the K's.  And, there was 2 games that I drawed with a dead position.  This happened before joining this website.  So, the summary is that Jack said that I went wrong by moving too quickly in the beginning which is why he allowed me to draw this game.  I agree with my coach, but he, as usual, he is not completely accurate.  Where I agree was the urge to play Nd5 too early.  The first one was 11.Nd5?? which would have left me a piece down.  And, the second instance was 16.Nd5 which would've lost a pawn.  So, he is correct in that sense.  But, what Jack did not point out was where I also went wrong.  In this case, it was 53.Rd7?  I would've had a win with 53.Kd5! as the K supports the pawn.  It also has to do with mobility since the K and passed pawn would work together to force the promotion.  Thus, while I need to take a little longer due to the opening, my assessment on mobility needs work.  I have gotten better at thinking more about it.  But, when to apply it is still shaky.  As I didn't think about it in the place where it was needed the most.  So, the real moral of this story is that mobility is one of the most important aspects in chess.  And, where to apply it is critical.  What I have learned from this game is that it's needed more in the endgame then any other phases of the game.

"Apprezzabile l'understatement di Klaus 😄 In realtà ha spazzato via i miei piani come l'asteroide di Chikxulub ha cancellato i dinosauri. Ma come in ogni battaglia, anche negli scacchi ogni piano non resiste un istante all'impatto con il nemico. Perciò, proseguiamo...
Analizzando e analizzando, sono giunto alla conclusione che:
- è meglio mettere pedoni in cascina attaccando quelli centrali con l'alfiere
- ci sono varie opzioni, c'è il mio cavallo che può attaccare in modo pericoloso, c'è il remoto sogno dell'arrocco che migliorerebbe tantissimo la mia posizione; ma tutte le varianti finiscono con materiale pari. Devo cercare solo di evitare i pedoni doppiati.

Perciò...

11. Axe7


,Effettivamente era la mossa che mi aspettavo. Penso che a questo punto il sogno di arroccare del bianco sia andato a frantumarsi come la cometa sulla tanguska.
La prossima sequenza di mosse, (12. Axd6 DxDd2 13. RxDd2 b6 14. Cd5 Td4 o Cc6 ecc.) giocata in un modo o nell'altro non cambierà il conseguimento di una una posizione di pura parità sulla scacchiera.
Il bianco si troverà con un pedone in più ma isolato che probabilmente sarà la prossima vittima della mia torre. L'impossibilità di arroccare e pertanto una leggera perdita di tempo per quanto riguarda la messa in sicurezza del proprio Re.
Se invece vorrà catturare la mia donna con la sua rischierà di trovarsi con i pedoni in ""d"" doppiati.
Insomma non mi lamento  
, Hai ragione, il mio pedone d è esposto come un fante russo davanti alle mitragliatrici della Wehrmacht (appropriate le metafore astrofisiche e belliche). Difendo l'avamposto o ""dasvidanie""? E' il mio busillis per le prossime mosse. Conto su alcuni fatti:
- la possibilità di difendere il pedone d e sviluppare i pezzi contemporaneamente;
- l'ala di regina del nero ancora non sviluppata;
- il mio re che, se andrà come tutto fa credere in d2, darà i vantaggi dell'arrocco (torri connesse e libere) con una sola mossa persa;
- alcune combinazioni futuribili interessanti;
per conquistare un lieve vantaggio strategico. ""Rodina!"" 

,Cc6 da parte del nero? E' un possibilità, ma in questo caso darei al Bianco la possibilità di arroccare cosa che, anche se di poco conto, preferisco non dare.
Ripeto, la mossa Cc6 non fa una grinza, e pertanto puoi tranquillamente valorizzare di molto la metafora   Infatti il proseguimento delle mosse (DxD, AxD, 0-0-0, AxC, bXA) produrrebbe due pedoni bianchi in linea a tutto vantaggio per il nero,
Preferisco però, come dicevo prima, giocare

12. ... DxDd2
13. RxDd2 b6

aggiungo questa mossa che penso, a meno che Stefano non voglia suicidarsi, è costretto a fare. Inserisco anche la mai risposta.
La situazione sulla scacchiera è ancora molto equilibrata e le posizioni di tutti i pezzi, a mio vedere sono abbastanza libere di entrare in azione. L'unico fuori posto è il Re bianco, ma questo era il fine che perseguivo.


,.
,.

,Klaus, se tu avessi fatto Cc6, io non avrei fatto DxD, ma 0-0-0, aspettando sempre e comunque che la donna la prendessi tu, oppure Ad3, cambiando completamente i giochi.
Una curiosità: come tua 12ma mossa mi aspettavo f5 e non DxD, ti avrebbe fatto recuperare il pedone (seppur isolato a sua volta… ma passato!), avrebbe sì scoperto il tuo re, ma lo scambio di donne era imminente e dunque il pericolo relativo.

Okay per le mosse da te indicate, naturalmente:
12. … DxD
13. RxD b6

Soon molto indeciso tra due mosse, Te1 e Ad3. Le voglio fare entrambe, si tratta solo di decidere quale fare prima. L’altra torre, nei miei piani, andrà a controllare la colonna f.
Deciso: sviluppo l’alfiere in una casella sì difensiva, ma centrale, copro il re, difendo il pedone e, liberando (a tempo debito) il cavallo, e le due torri possono correre.

14. Ad3 
,Beh. Se qualcuno non sbaglia o non fa una svista, tutte le partite finirebbero patte  
Comunque la mia decisione di non recuperare il pedone di svantaggio è che considero il pedone bianco in d al momento inoffensivo ed ho l'impressione, che quanto prima il potenziale sulla scacchiera tornerà in parità.
Si dice che l'erba del vicino è sempre più verde, ma in quest'occasione, non vedo alcuna differenza nel colore. Il bianco, nella sua struttura dei giochi attuale, secondo il mio modo di giocare è troppo aperto e leggermente soffocato dai propri pezzi che, pur possedendo posizioni abbastanza forti, sono impossibilitati a muovere senza indebolire la formazione.
Io non sto molto meglio, ma, dopo la mossa di cavallo, la mia formazione risulta consolidata e rende la casa e5 meno forte per il bianco. 
,Sono d'accordo con Klaus, il cavallo in c6 è molto attivo, può raggiungere posti interessanti, e soprattutto può far fuori, senza che io possa far molto praticamente per impedirlo, il mio alfiere chiaro (analizzare per credere), dunque per evitare guai peggiori sviluppo la mia torre e mi preparo a difendermi. D'altra parte c'è chi dice che il 'bad bishop' (come si dice in italiano?) vale meno di un cavallo nel centropartita... la mossa della torre serve anche per toglierle di dosso il mirino telescopico dell'alfiere nero. E poi sostiene lo spavaldo pedone e.
Ho analizzato anche l'opzione ""pedone b2 al curaro"" (è sempre lui!), ovvero Cb5 o Cd5, ma non porta da nessuna parte.
Che cosa mi aspetto? Ce5 o Td8, ma Klaus mi ha già sorpreso più volte.

15. Te1 

,Nuovamente scelgo una mossa che non hai prospettato  , anche se, sinceramente, considerate le sue possibili conseguenze, è pienamente plausibile.
Contrariamente a Stefano cerco sempre di non aprire troppo il mio gioco ma di controllare quello dell'avversario a distanza.
Effettivamente potevo muovere anche Ce5 o altre mosse, ma al momento, preferisco costruire una buona difesa nel modo sopraindicato.
Se osservate bene la ragione di Ae6 e le conseguenze di una sua incursione, dopo una mossa di torre, vi accorgerete che la mossa non è per nulla di poco valore.
Ora vediamo la risposta di Stefano. Af4? 

,Ho studiato a lungo la variante ""folle"", ovvero Cb5, proponendo uno scambio torre per pedone + alfiere, lasciando però a Klaus una posizione finale molto favorevole, con il mio cavallo in castigo e tutti i pezzi neri in centro e pronti all'attacco: chissà come sarebbe finita. Probabilmente molto male per me  

La mossa che mi prospetta Klaus non mi piace, perché significherebbe abbandonare con l'alfiere una posizione dove controlla caselle utili alle torri e al cavallo neri. L'attacco Ah6+ seguito da Cd4+ si limiterebbe a spostare il mio re in caselle sicure, dove già dovrebbe stare se mi fosse stato permesso l'arrocco   . Preferisco consolidare la difesa con b3, che para la minaccia Thd8 o Ted8 seguita da Axc4 dopo aver spostato il mio alfiere da d6 (era questa l'incursione, Klaus?)

16. b3 

,Chissà perché, ma considero la tua mossa un (piccolo) errore.
Il mio consiglio di Af4 era un celato avviso alla mia prossima mossa che, oltre a portare scacco al tuo re, mi fa guadagnare il dominio della diagonale h6-c1. Considerati i pochi pezzi che possono intromettersi, è un chiodino (di garofano) che potrebbe infastidirti  
Dopo la mia prossima mossa di minaccia al tuo Ad6 con Td8, il tuo alfiere dovrà per forza andarsene, ma non potrà più rifugiarsi in g3 perché probabilmente forzerei lo scambio che, a mio parere, volge a mio favore, ma in a3 posto dal quale non è un minaccia per nessuno.

Ricapitolando:
16. ... Ah6+
17. Rc2 (penso sia la mossa migliore. Non consiglio Rd1  )
17. ... Ted8


,.

,.

,Sono d'accordo sulla prosecuzione:

16. ... Ah6+
17. Rc2 Ted8

Ag3 è fuori questione per via di Cb4+ che guadagna l'alfiere e sbanca. Scartata anche Cb5, che finisce con il mio cavallo intrappolato in e6. Ci sarebbe la variante ""giudiziosa"", Aa3 (l'alfiere tornerebbe utile una volta spostato in b2). Ma io sono uno scacchista scapestrato, e gioco la rischiosa e5. Analizzando, c'è la possibilità di mantenere o meno il pedone di vantaggio, con una posizione leggermente migliore; naturalmente, c'è anche la possibilità di uno sfacelo  

Che cosa mi aspetto? Interessante è Cd4+, seguita da Cf5. Oppure f6, seguita da... una carneficina  

,Penso che Antonio abbia visto giusto. e5 è stato un grosso errore. Logicamente per parequarmi al tuo modo di gioco, faccio anch'io una mossa che non hai contemplato.

18. ... Txd6, ................mi aspetto il logico
19. exTd6, ..................ora apriamo le stalle  
19. ... Cb4+ ................qui mi aspetto anche il più che logico
20. Rb1 (con Rb2 ci rimetti la torre per il mio cavallo) CxAd3

se non sei d'accordo su queste mosse, scrivimi quelle che preferisci giocare.
Penso che a questo punto tu debba cercare di scompaginare il mio schieramento eliminando con la tua torre il mio alfiere in e6. Questo pezzo rischia di causarti ancora più danni se me lo lasci spostare in f5. Non trovi?
Certo è che a questo punto la situazione non è delle più rosee per il bianco. Un finale di torre e cavallo contro torre, cavallo ed alfiere non è delle più auspicabili.

,I did not even see this coming 
,the silver line is  Black  might spend time in repositioning the rook
,I wanted to keep f4 option open
,Guarding the e pawn
,looked for ways to trap the rook ....
,I did not note that the Rook has the Queens support now. This move will also allow me swing to the queen side
,stopping Bg5 ?
,The plan was to exchange of the c5 Knight by playing Nc1,Nb3. Now I realised that black can play b5 and I can lose my bishop pair
,? changed plans -- now I planned Nf6 and after Bxf6 exf6 I can play Ne4 -- or that was the plan
,Should have stuck to Nf5 ?
,oops -- now black owns the center and I saw the pawn storm and I am losing a piece :-(
,definitely losing a piece :-( was very very unhappy 
,Keeping some chances with a King side attack ??
,I can take the pawn and black will take the a pawn -- and I dont see anything good 
,? Is Black getting over aggressive ? was this a blunder ? I can get the piece ? and be exchange down ?
,? I could have released the pin with Qe3 ? 
,?  I got hope now :-) I think Black  made a few very passive moves

"This was a lucky draw. I grabbed a pawn, but it resulted in my queen being lost for rook, knight and two pawns. In theory that material imbalance is favourable to me, but in practice in the open board his queen is  much stronger, and I am fortunate to escape with a draw.
,It looks like he will play an Indian Defence.
,I continue with my usual.
,He picked up his e pawn, twirled it in the air, and I though he was going to play a Nimzo-Indian Defence, but he put it down on e5 - the Budapest Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Gambit

,Taking is by far the most popular move.
,After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but after 4. a3! white has an advantage.
,I switched to this, after I learned how white can't hang onto the extra pawn safely. This move attacks the black knight.
,So he takes the pawn.
,I attack the knight again.
,The most sensible move, although Nb-c6 is an interesting piece sacrifice, but black doesn't get quite enough.
,Preventing 6.....Bc5 and white can't castle.
,This is the most common move.
,This seemed to me to be the most logical, preventing black from doubling my c pawns if I had played Nc3. I was surprised to learn afterwards than 7. Nc3 is in fact more usual.
,7....Qe7 threatening the pawn on e4 is more common.
,So I protect the e pawn.
,He develops.
,So do I - I am keen to get my king out of the centre, away from possible pressure down the e file, and also breaking the pin on Nd2.
,He pins my other knight.
,As planned. 
,And he completes the development of his minor pieces. I found out afterwards that this position has occurred in a couple of Gameknot games, both times white played a3 and black won, although this position is very level still, and in both games white made mistakes later.

"I'd say a weak move, but true is that white has a game going on with Bb5 followed by BxN and Ne5.
,This IS a waste of a move, it just helps me in my developement (which foresees a pawn storm on the Kside).
,Stop, this is necessary here in order to prevent Nb5. 8. Ne5 prevents it, but kind of ""discovers the cards"" too soon. It's better to let the opponent the chance to go on with ""second best"" moves!... :-)
,This is the most sensible move. Not any sensible player would go for b5 at once... ;-)
,He choses to exchange it. Better thand Nd6, useless while the pawn can retake supported by the B. The only thing I didn't comment: Here, black seems to own the white squares, and he does... but while my N is in d2, I have nothing to fear: a black N in e4 doesn't bother me too much, I can go on attacking. If the B goes there, I'll exchange it. That's in theory. 
,Here, I CAN play Nf3. If black removes his N to c5 (in order to let his lsb come to e4), I'll have time to move my R away from the pin, and then play calmly Ng5, and black has to retire it or have it exchanged. After Bg6 I would control e4 with my own lsb...
,...but I went for this, instead. The idea is that black's lsb has to find shelter in h7, blocking the R's action on the h file...(of course, my move is also preventing Qh4...)
,...and then there is this. I hate this, because the MOST SENSIBLE move is... KxN. Because my Q has to stay on the light squares, ready to go to a4+ or supporting the K's pawnstorm... But of curse, my K will be exposed, and if black finds c5 at once... I can die quickly and sadly. So I saw leaks on my ""preparation"", up to this point... and, sigghing, I played...
,Now black can really occupy the e4 square, and I have no N to exchange it. Bad thing. 
,I have to guard h4, of course. 
,No, black, no, you had to play c5. I always play c5, it's ""always"" good against the London, and it's basic chess principles (this time they do work!). Now, I can't say I made my point on the opening if I don't get some kind of compensation, attack or something. 
,I try to bother him and force to open the game before he safely castles queenside. 
,Probably the best. At least, I made it for a tempo, now... if I retire my B, I'll lose h4, and if I let it there, I'll lose a pawn in g5... Of course, the easy way is BxB, with an equal game... and a not very interesting one (except for large, strategic endgames, which I adore, but not on blitz!).
,...and this was the other one. I know, will take care of his lsb later. I have to cause him to react...
,Well! One of the best possible outcomes for me. 
,My pawns can become a potential threat.
,Finally! Ok, I expected it any moment. Now, a classical way is o-o-o, but it povokes black's fury. The hidden threat will come later, with Bb6, threatening e3, which had become very weak. I dared to play f4 just because no N or dsb are left on the black side. I sensed it was not wise to let him play it undisturbed. 
,Do you like it?
,? I think e4 by black would have crushed me... anyway...
,I can't allow further exchanges if I don't get some advantage in return. Rh5, and if fxe5, Re6+, followed by Rxe5 sounds good, but black wouldn't necessarily fall for it.

"Wicked little move, and I don't know whether it's an error or not, having no analysis. It certainly threw up some possibilities for both sides. taking the Queen and allowing 34...bxc2 seemed risky indeed, with the Rook on b8 ready to come down and support the pawn.
,I thought Black might play 34...b2, allowing me to capture the d or f-pawn with check, and hopefully a strong attack...
,Presumably because 34...fxe5 allows a check on g5, Black takes with the other pawn. But this allows me to win material...
,Now I can cover the Queening square...
,Win the hanging h-pawn and threaten to force an exchange of Rooks!
,Black covers the pawn, but it's a little late...
,I'd rather hoped Black might go to e6, after which 40.Rxc8 Rxc8 41.Qxa6 wins. Never mind - I'm still happy...
,Bakc to covering the Queening square.
,Black heads towards the K-side and a little cover, and we're in an endgame, so of course I start to go wrong. It seems clear now that the best plan is to advance my King up the K-side with the passed h-pawn; Black can't bring his Rook across or his own pawn witll fall...
,Instead I get the idea I can give up my Queen for the Rook and pawn and win the resulting position. This might work, excpe tBlack has moves too...
,Foolishly hoping I can play 47.Qg5+ next, which would win the Rook after 47...Kh7 48.Qxf5+
,Like I say, Black gets moves too...
,I carry on with my plan, which seems the height of foolishness now.
,Now to deal with those advancing pawns. Except in advancing the h-pawn in the hope of an error I've given Black a chance - 
,Suddenly it doesn't seem so easy; there's a passed pawn to deal with. heading up the board to capture the pawn on a6 is not going to be an option; I'm forced to use my King in defence...
,Keeping me out of the crucial f4 square.
,I'm forced back to defend the g-pawn. Allowing its capture and playing h5 seems too risky.
,Clever use of a spare move!
,I still don't want to risk allowing the g-pawn to fall.

,And the queen is toast! Nothing White can do will save her queen. 
,Up by 4 points in material, but if it weren't for that blunder on move 24, it would only be one.
,What is more valuable, the pawn on d6 or the bishop trade on e3?
,I decide for the bishop trade. I need to press my advantage, and this opens up a threat for Qxc2. 
,Up by 6 now. With White's queen gone, the maneuverability of White's forces has dropped significantly.
,Threaten the knight capture.
,Basic knight fork here.
,Now, the lead is by 10 points in material. White simply cannot catch up at this point, barring a pawn promotion that I allow to happen, which would be a huge blunder on my side.
,Grinding down White's forces, little by little.
,At this point, White resigns. With a bonus queen, bishop, and a pawn, there simply is nothing White can do. Ultimately, the way I saw it, is that this game was lost on move 24. If White had taken my bishop rather than pushed a pawn, he would have been able to stop Kd6 to support Bb6. His queen would have remained alive a while longer while he may have figured out a way to save it. But in the end, the queen trap worked, and White was whittled down piece by piece by piece.

"after long and careful consideration, this hidden sacrifice is the strongest move: after fxg5?, Qxg5+, Qg7, Rxe5, Black can safely give up; the combined threat of Bxf6, followed by at some point occupying the seventh row, breaks up Blacks' position instantly... eg.

"Today on ""I annotate a game"" I wanted to start a little series. I have recently been playing around with the Evan's gambit and am trying to learn it properly. As part of this process I thought that I would annotate my games, good or bad, win or lose, and show you my thought process as it evolves. As it turns out this game was a great one to start on as I got a great position and went in for a crushing attack and was better very quickly. Doesn't always work out this way, but this game was nice. 
,If black plays instead Nf6 I've also been playing around with the Max Lange attack, a very similar opening in a lot of ways. 
,Signifying the Evan's Gambit. The idea behind this attack and many similar opening gambits is to sacrifice a pawn for active counterplay on some part of the board, relying on compensation for the pawn. What is the compensation here? White intends to castle quickly, get the rooks in the middle and somehow keep black's king in the middle to attack. Alternatively there is often a strong attack against the f7 pawn if black castles with the bishop on c8 undeveloped. So white is playing against passive pieces and a slightly airy king. Lets see how this one goes. 
,The most critical lines of a gambit are ones where the sacrifice is accepted. It is not considered a good idea to take with the knight, and on move 5.. we will explain this further.  Suffice to say if you are going to take, bishop is best. If you wish to decline, Bb6 is fine, and if I play game in that line I'll also annotate to see what we can learn about that position. Enough to say it is also a reasonable alternative. 
,Pushing the bishop back with tempo. 
,You might wonder why not Bc5 and the position is very similar to the earlier position on move 3 but white has given up a pawn. Not so. If 5..Bc5 then 6. d4 exd4 7. cxd4 and white has a very strong center and easy development. Black's pieces are awkward and has a lot of problems to overcome. This whole idea is why taking with the knight on the previous move doesn't really work. White still just plays c3 here, and d4 next, with a nice center, easy development and soon will look for a strong attack. 5..Ba5 aims to stop all that because if d4 then the c3 pawn is pinned to the king and can't retake, making that strong center. Which white player would try that.
,[?!]Apparently I would. Don't get me wrong, the c pawn is pinned to the king and can't retake. So this is now a three(!) pawn sacrifice if black wants it. The best way to play here would be O-O and only then to play d4. d4 is playable to be sure, but white has give away enough pawns that they now MUST get an attack going or the material advantage will be decisive. Some line like 6. O-O d6 7. d4 and black has many options that don't include giving white the massive center. 
,Again, taking is the best way to refute a gambit. What might white be planning. 
,White calmly castles. This must be the best move in the position, but white has given away three pawns for active play. Is this worth it? Maybe. Probably not at the Grandmaster level, but this does see play at almost all other levels of chess. 
,Black accepts the gambit'ed pawn again, but gives up the potentially powerful bishop on a5. I think dxc3 is a better try because in this line the rook quickly comes to e1 aiming at the king, but with the bishop on a5 that is not always possible. 
,White take a bishop that has moved now 4 times in the opening with a piece that has moved once. That is how to get ahead in development...even at the cost of pawns. 
,Clearly, though the pawn on c3 is probably falling. 
,With pressure against f7. This move is common to many possible lines in the Evan's gambit, and is an idea to be looking out for. 
,Protecting the f7 pawn. Nh6 fails to Bxh6 and f7 is falling. Qf6 and then e5. Nothing here is decisive for white, but all of them give white great attacking chances. 
,Developing a piece with tempo. 
,Seems forced. Qf6 is just like it was the previous move but now white has an extra piece developed. Now maybe black can develop the bishop on c8. 
,Taking advantage of the pin on the d6 pawn and that the black queen is guarding f7. I was somewhat temped by Re8 here as well, but that just seemed too slow to me. Note that that pawn on c3 has been hanging for a white now but white really cannot afford to take it because it gives black the tempo they need to consolidate. 
,This move surprised me. I though Qd7 or Be6 were better tries here, with this move looking like a bit of a waste. If something like 12. Qxc3 Nxc4 13. Qxc4 then white has traded a piece for whites very powerful attacking piece. Can you see the move that keeps white's attacking going strong. 
,Of course. Obvious maybe, but powerful. Black must go bad to c6 or lose a piece. Black has 4 pieces that still have not moved from their starting positions and white only has 1. Black really needs very precise play from here even to have a chance of holding. I will note the computer has liked white's position for a number of moves yet but this is the one where it's best variations start giving up material for active piece play, which is normally how I determine that one side is actually properly ahead. Of course white has to play well to take advantage, and nothing is easy, but this is a very nice position. 
,Force or black is losing the knight.

"Now White is on top... ish.  
,Forced.  The alternative would have lost.  I'll leave it to the reader to figure out how.  Clue: White can force checkmate after 37...Kf8.
,[?!] The game now reverts to equality, which, in many respects would have been a very satisfactory result from a spectator's point of view.  But White ought to have offered one more check before snaffling the knight: 38.Ra8ch Bc8  39.Qxe2.  This would have taken the rook off the vulnerable dark-square diagonals, and, the exchange ahead, with passed pawns on the Q-side, White could have made Black work hard just to survive.  But White is by no means behind, even here, provided he stays alert...  Incidentally, even 38.Rxd7ch Kxd7  39.Qxe2 would have led to no disadvantage for White.
,Again, safer is Kg1, but the game is still even...
,Looks like we're heading for a perpetual...
,[??] Disaster.  You can see what White was about, can't you: the threat against d7.  But he has overlooked one vital consideration.  Such a shame, for the draw was in his hand after 42.Kf2 Qc5ch 43.Qe3.
,0-1 Joe tossed in the sponge at this point, as well he might.  But this was a terrific game, I thought, full of incident.  It shows what can happen with players of widely different strengths and experience, when one plays a little below par, and the other rather above.  A fast-paced helter-skelter ride like this!

"Black demands a high price for that h-pawn.  I had set its value, by now,  at higher than the two White passers.  Could that value be realised?  Let's see!
,We've been here before, but things were different, then...
,A tempo gainer.  The King will take over the protection of the h-pawn, whilst the minor pieces continue their operations elsewhere.
,Now the Black h-pawn is at least as big a menace as White's two passed pawns,  and White has been driven into a relatively passive position.  But White is by no means yet bereft of resources,
,Threatens ...Nd4ch.
,Preventing the knight fork ...Nd4ch.  But now the Black King is permitted to invade via g4.  But after, say, 64.Rb2 or Rh3, then ...Ne7 aiming for ...Ng6, leads to a strong attack for Black anyway.  Probably best was 64.Rh1, which seems to lead to Black having to let go the h-pawn to round up the White g- and f-pawns: 64.Rh1 and [A] 64...Nd4ch 65.Ke4 Nxb3 (...Ne2 might offer more) 66.Rd1 Nc5ch? (...Kg6 is better) 67.Kf5 h3  68.Rg1! Nxa4 (really greedy, eh?) 69.Rg3 Kh4 70.Rg4ch Kh5 71.Rg3 Kh4 etc and a draw by repetition.  [B] 64...Be7(!) 65.Rd1 h3 66.Rd7 h2  67.Kg2 Bd6 68.Kxh2 Bxf4ch when Black has an edge, but, as earlier discussed, maybe not enough.
,White has threats of his own!  If White allows the pawn to advance on more square, then ...Nxg7; Rg2ch wins for White.  This probably represents as good a chance as any for White, but now the game begins to slip away from him.  About now I was starting to fancy my chances of a win.
,Forced, to allow ...Ng3 in response to Rg2ch (were White to play that).
,66.Kd5 is the same but 66...Bg7 in reply is no check.
,Dual purpose.  The bishop and knight together effectively blockade the g-pawn - or at least have it under close surveillance.  At the same time, the bishop covers the f2-square, allowing the king to threaten the f-pawn.
,To regain access to the f-file, and so the f-pawn is once again protected (68...Kxf4?? 69.Rf1ch wins a piece).
,! - Played to prevent Kd5.  I did consider 68...c5, here, but was a bit concerned about the exposure of the b6-pawn to attack. This move leaves the c6-pawn weak, but it seemed to me that it were better to give that one up for the two White K-side pawns than to relinquish the h-pawn.  I was by now valuing the h-pawn as worth a rook.  It was not long before White reached the same conclusion.
,Maybe 70.c5!? was worth a look?  70.c5 Bxc5 71.Rxh4!? ... and now [A] 71...Nxh4?? loses to 72.g7!, but [B] 71...Kxh4  72.Kxf5 Bd4 and Black should win this end game.  
,A little bit of a surprise, this, as I was expecting 70.Kxc6 Ne7ch 71.Kd6 Nxg6 72.f5  Nf4 or something similar.
,!? - The alternative was a case of 'as you were': 71...Nf5ch 72,Ke5, and then try 72...Ng3.  I could have played ...Ng3 at move 70, but felt that the king was the better piece to guide the h-pawn home.
,There was nothing better.
,Naturally, 74.Rxd4 is hopeless.  But the rook will have to be given up for the pawn.  Black has now a winning game - for a given value of 'winning'.  White isn't going to give this one away.
,Now White's next two moves are forced.
,! - Grand master Paul Keres once remarked that few positions are so hopeless as to offer no hope whatever of offering resistance.  White realises that he can wipe out Black's last remaining pawns, leaving himself with the bare King-bishop-knight end game.  Now, if he can force Black to give up a piece for a fast running passed pawn, the game would be drawn.  Which will be the runner?  White's a-pawn!
,! - This is how to force an exchange or the win of material.  Immobilise the target, then attack it.  Well, Black's pawn was immobilised way back at move 6, but the principle is the same.  Black will have no pawns left.

"Charles starts off with his usual.
,Not surprisingly, since Janet has also played this move, ION is either going for, Benoni Defense the Colle's System, or KID.  Time will tell.
,It looks like this has become the Benoni Defense because 2.e3 is played in the Colle's System.  And, unlike with other openings, it can't transpose here since the Colle's Franketort does not have white playing c4. 
,As it turns out, ION decided to play the KID.  This is very interesting as I do have a little experience with it, after playing against it in my first training game with Ken.  And, what makes it even more interesting is that it is headed into unfamiliar territory, as we will see later on.  That makes it even more educational because it shows just how intense openings can be, as the trainer emphasized.  Likewise, it also shows that ION is very familiar with this opening.
,Meanwhile, Charles continues with his development.
,As anticipated.
,I was a little surprised by this move as he is breaking through before castling.  But, it is interesting.  That for me is something new because I would've done something different, like 4.g3 to fianchetto.  That doesn't make it bad, but rather something for me to learn since it shows that there can be several variations in the KID as this position illustrates.
,Meanwhile, this makes move sense as ION opens a line for his B.  Obviously, no good would be 4...b7 since in general, but especially in the KID, a double fianchetto is not wise, as Ken explained.
,I was a little surprised to see this played.  In this position, I very much like 5.Nf3 as it develops and gets Charles ready to castle.  However, I like this to since white has a nice pawn chain.  
,Of course, as Jack Stockel puts it, ION plays it safe by castling.
,That's where Charles uses the opportunity to continue with his development.
,ION wants to exchange here.
,But, like with my first game against Ken, Charles refuses.
,This is an interesting square.  As, ION preparing to give way to a check.  I wonder why the idea is to check since it appears that Charles can get out of it easily.  But, there's gotta to be something else.
,Mobilizing his Queen and preparing to castle long.  What makes it interesting is both players castling on opposite wings which we don't see too often.
,I anticipated 9.Bf2.  But, I like this move just as much.
,This is a move that I would not have considered.  At first glance, it appears that ION gave away a piece.  But, he hasn't because of white's Rh1.  Instead, it gets interesting.
,As it appears that Charles is well protected. 
,But, ION gives away his Queen for two pieces and a pawn.  Similar to what happened with Ken, being able to do this means that ION is very familiar with this variation.
,Knowing that his c4 pawn cannot be protected, Charles hits the N.  But, this gives ION back a pawn.

"I need to get my King towards the centre.

,He's not having that!
,A rather knee-jerk move, putting my pawn on a dark square to no great advantage I wouldn't think.
,Always more assertive with pawn moves, now my b-pawn can't go to b4 any time soon.
,Hoping to get my Rook to the b-file...
,Quite missing this obvious reply, which has the added advantage of fixing that b-pawn on its home square.

,Another let-off, since pawns down on either side would have probably spelled the end.
,Now I have finally got rid of that light-squared Bishop - the one that's supposed to have trouble finding its place in this opening and which has been the source of some irritation.
,Now we're at something of a stand-off, each threatening the other's pawn, while defending our own. But I'm still a pawn down.

I like it a little better.  penguin_: vote 11 Bb2 My vote is for Bb2  ynwa77: Vote 11.Nd4
I think black needs to play very well to maintain it's pressure after this move.  knightrider62: Vote Bb2
My vote is with penguin's suggestion Bb2  ynwa77: If we move Bb2
And black responses Qc5 what do we do next? 
If we try exchange, then 
12. Bxc3...Qxe3+ 
13. Be2....Qxc3  knightrider62:  I change my vote to Nd4
I change my vote to Nd4.  penguin_: Look at this if we play Bb2 & Black plays Qc5
1.	Bb2	Qc5 
2.	Nd4	Ba5 

We gain some control of the center and open it up  Could even follow with Qf3
Could even think about following with Qf3 and consider driving the N away.  ynwa77: Penguin,
Bb2 looks actually pretty good way you explained it, but I still like Nd4 more  penguin_: Here is an Nd4 senario
Nd4	Bxd4 
exd4	Qxf4 

now we are down 2 pawns and the K is exposed to their Q  easy-win: penguin
1.	Nd4	Bxd4 
2.	exd4	Qxf4 
3.	Nf3	 

And the black queen is exposed to our BSB.  penguin_: Stealth
Agreed but we are still down another pawn and black can take the Q to a number of safe positions including Qd6. 
Don't see how we come out ahead on this or even even. Vote Bb2
I still prefer Bb2 my vote is Bb2  falcon67: My vote is Bb2.I also looked at Moving the king to f2.It is an idea .Something to think about though.  knightrider62: Why is it good to trade in this position where we are a pawn down or does it only matter not to trade when we are a piece down. I like Bb2 though and also Kf2 can't make up my mind which to vote for.  falcon67: It would be good to hopefully trade off queens at some point .Yes we shouldnt just trade off a bunch of pieces sorry my bad lol.My vote is still Bb2 for now.  knightrider62: I vote to change move I change my vote back to Bb2 along with penguin and falcon67.  redfoxrising: I'll take part and sggest Bb2
I will also suggest the Bb2 move
  

,In this position, I didn't want to be the first one to exchange.  As I had considered 11...Bxb2.  But, after that exchange, their Nd2 would no longer be pinned.  My idea was to keep it pinned.  However, I think that better might have been 11...Bb4 or 11...Ba5 to try to avoid the exchange.  As my B was more active.  On the other hand, when all is said and done, the pin will remain.
,knightrider62: if we play a3 the queen will either go to a5 where it still AIDS the bishop on c3 or to b6 where it threatens to take the pawn on e3 and give check looks like a trade of bishops is inevitable.  redfoxrising: my suggestion might be to use the king as an attacker Kf2  easy-win: Vote 12. BXB Moving our king away from our d2 bishop is a blunder.  We lose the bishop without recompense.  penguin_: Vote 12 BxB I like the BxB best right now.  knightrider62: Vote BxB I also think BxB is best.  falcon67: I vote for BxB too.  ynwa77: Vote a3
A3...Qc5 
Nd4...Bxb2 
E4...Qc3 

And this is only worse option I discovered.  easy-win: Ynwa77
I cannot see too much harm in a3, it is just that 
if we allow a build up around our king, it may be 
dangerous by allowing black to increase tension. 

We need to allow more time for two more votes, 
before making a determining continuation.  penguin_: Playing a3
I must be missing something somewhere, but when I play the moves as suggested by ynwa77 and play blacks it's best moves as shown below we end up down 7 instead of down 1? 

1. a3	Qc5 
2.Nd4 Bxb2	 
3.e4	Bxd4  easy-win: Penquin
You are correct if we follow that sequence. 

I only considered a3 to move the queen away, but 
did not care to analyze further because of my 
voting preference for BXB. 

Thanks for your input 
,ynwa77: Penguin If we play way you post starting a3, we would take black's Q next move and then be +2.  easy-win: May I humbly suggest
Let's put the a3 move behind us for now, 
and just wait to see what Joe moves. 

Okay?   Meanwhile, this move was forced to prevent the loss of material.  I think that I probably would've been better off to retreat, as noted on my last move.  But, I'm happy at where I am given that white's N is still pinned.   
,ynwa77: Vote Kf2 Seems logical and I dont see any instant danger there.  falcon67: I vote for Kf2 as well force the knight to move.  redfoxrising: kf2 is mine also  easy-win: Vote 13.Kf2
The only logical move at this time. 
Our d2 knight no longer needs 2 guards, and we 
will rid ourselves of the pesky knight threat.  penguin_: Vote 13. Kf2
I am good with this, white is breaking Blacks momentum.  knightrider62: Vote Kf2
I agree with this majority vote. 
,This is what I had overlooked.  I was thinking that I'd allow the exchange and keep the pin, but similar to a loss against Joann, followed by, the loss with Jack Stockel, I forgot that the K could move.  So, I really should've retreated earlier.  As now, I don't know where to go from here.  
,easy-win: Vote 14.Nf-d4
The pawn at c7 will probably threaten that knight on the 
next move, however, we can find an excellent square 
for it, if that happens.  redfoxrising: my vote is same 14. Nfd4  ynwa77: Vote 14. Nd4 Seems logical and we start to dictate the tempo.  falcon67: Yes my vote is for Nfd4 as well.  knightrider62: Vote Nfd4
My vote also is for Nfd4.
,I gave this move a lot of thought.  In other words, I trying to figure out what to do and was struggling.  For one thing, I don't like blocking squares for one of my minor pieces.  But, white is threatening 15.Nb5.  With which, they'd be guaranteed to win a R and pawn for free, given that it can capture on c7.  So, I thought that this move was my only option.  14...a6 was also an option.  But, I didn't think it through well enough, as there was another option that I forgot.  Best would've been 14...Bd7.  It was a case of Tunnel Vision as I focused too much on the threat but forgot that my LSB could've covered the same diagonal as the b5 square.  And, it would've developed another piece.
,ynwa77: Vote 15. b4 Black has only one move to escape and if he makes that we still can put pressure other side of board.  easy-win: Vote 15.N-e2
Upon moving the last suggested move, 15.b4 the queen will move to 
a3, and since it will threaten the b2 pawn, I do not see the advantage. 

BTW My user name will be easy-win in the near future.  ynwa77: If we b4
And black Qa3, we can g4 and put pressure to black and try to make him make mistake. If he plays right he can escape, but isn't that case in every move?  easy-win: ynwa77
I went to the analysis and followed the moves 
which ended with the knight all the way to the 
7th rank, and still cannot see a good benefit.  ynwa77: Steath-invader
There is quite many different possibilities and if Joe plays everything correct there will not be advantage in pieces to us. My point is that there are many moves where we can put pressure to black and that way he could make wrong move. 
If you think time is not right yet then we need to wait for better position, but I like my move no matter how much I think of it. 
Wouldn't be first time I'm wrong tough.  easy-win: ynwa77
Upon analyzing for the third time, here is my take on your suggested move. 
Please note we will have lost another pawn on a 3 in this sequence.. 

Please send me your analysis, and perhaps I may be able to consider the advantage. 


1.	b4	Qa3 
2.	g4	Nf6 
3.	g5	Nh5 
4.	Be2	Qxa2 
5.	N2b3	Qa4 
6.	Nc5	Qa3 
7.	Rb3	Qa  falcon67: My vote is for Ne2 as well.  penguin_: Vote Ne2 I'll go along with Ne2.  redfoxrising: same 4 me Ne2 

,I thought about where to move my Q.  But, after something like 15...Qa5, they have 16.b4  And, if I played 15...Qb4, they hit it again with 16.c3  So, I didn't want to lose further tempo, and therefore, played this.  As now, there's also better mobility with my Q.
,easy-win: Vote 16.Nd-f3
The idea here, is to keep the queen from coming to 
h4 with a check. 
As it is now, moving our knight to g3 would entice black 
to exchange knights, when we would then put our king 
at a more vulnerable square, where it could be attacked 
by a king side pawn storm, backed by the queen and the 
white bishop at c8. 
Also that pawn on e3 is providing necessary protection 
to our center pawn at f4, 
If the black e pawn jumps two squares to e5, we can not 
move it, because it is pinned at this time by the queen, 
but with a knight on f3 we can capture that pawn if it 
moves there if he were to move it. 

When it is our time to vote, we should analyze by 
pressing anywhere on the board with our cursor.  redfoxrising: Same as Stealth I Vote 16.Nd-f3  falcon67: I vote for Nd-f3 as well.  penguin_: Vote 16.Nd-f3 I am good with this.  ynwa77: Vote 16. Nd-f3 Seems logical move.  knightrider62: Vote Nd-f3 I agree., also. 

,The reason behind this move is that it develops.  But, I am now ready to exchange.  I felt that my B was less active then theirs.
,redfoxrising: I vote for Bxf5, this takes our LSB's off the board (there is no other place to put or LSB) I't better than playing c3 or c4 as it would pin our Bishop  easy-win: I vote 17.BxB
Black will take bishop with the queen or the g pawn 
It will be to our advantage either way, after 18.p-g4 

However, as always, I invite you to please examine the whole board carefully 
to see if you may be able to discover something better. 

If you do, please explain in detail why another move might be better.  falcon67: Im good with the move BxB as well.  knightrider62: VOTE BxB I vote for the same BxB  penguin_: VOTE BxB I vote for the same BxB. VOTE BxB I vote for the same BxB.  ynwa77: Vote BxB. Don't see any other option.
,?? I took back this way.  As I thought that taking back with the g pawn would expose the K.  The idea is not to open it too much, unless it's absolutely necessary, or it's the endgame.  But, this is one of those times where it was necessary.  So, 17...gxf5 because of what's about to unfold.  Believe it or not, I have overlooked these kinds of things before, so there was something for me to learn.   
,easy-win: Vote 18.g4 
What I see, is two advantages, 

1.To fork the queen and the knight 

2.To clear the g file for possible future aggression  falcon67: Yes g4 is my vote as well .Yes forking queen and knight resulting in opening g file .Good analysis stealth.  redfoxrising: g4 for me also.  ynwa77: Vote g4 Seems very good.  knightrider62: Vote g4 I agree attacks queen and knight winning the knight.  redfoxrising: g4 is good for me.
,I also could've retreated to e6 or d7, but seeing that they're now going to get the advantage, I'm doing the best that I can to work around it.  My idea is trying to put pressure on both of their N's.  But, this move is exactly why 17...gxf5 was essential.  An important lesson is to be aware of these forks by trying to figure if there is something like a pawn or a piece, with which they can attack two pieces.  It seems basic, but for me, it isn't.  It's also about asking myself if a piece is going into an attack which is what allows the fork.  In addition, penguin_ left my club because of that mistake.
,easy-win: Vote 19..gxN As planned we can take a knight and lose our g pawn, which will open 
the g file for further aggression.  ynwa77: Vote 19.gxN I agree with Stealth-invader  knightrider62: Vote g xN
I agree gxN stealth is right  falcon67: Yes i vote for gxK as well.  redfoxrising: 19.gxN for my vote.

,With the mistake that I made, I had to capture to get a pawn as compensation.  As otherwise, I would've wound up being down a piece for a pawn.  By playing this, I have two pawns, in return.
,easy-win: Vote 20.Ne-g3 This move is prelude to the attack on the king which is now exposed at the g file.  ynwa77: Vote 20.Ne-g3 I was first thinking Ne-c3, but easy-win's idea is better.  knightrider62: My vote Ne-g3 My vote is Ne-g3  falcon67: My vote is for Ne-g3 as well.  redfoxrising: my Vote Neg3
,The idea behind retreating here, as opposed to, e6 was an attempt to put pressure on their Ng3.  What I'm keeping in mind is that they can't play 21.Kg2 without walking into a pin.  Not surprisingly, there's no pressure, but I'm doing what I can being that my advantage has been gone for a while.

"Missing the chance to drive back the King with 45...e5+ I could now advance the c-pawn out of the line of the Knight's fire...

"Once he castles, that's when I start following through on my plan.
,And, it's with this move.  Now, I had considered 15.Nxh6 with the same idea.  But, after 15...gxh6, 16.Bxh6 Re8, I don't know what white can do.  It looks like it, but there certainly isn't a mate.  That all came into consideration for which to take.  As this does work.  Unlike the previous variation, if black plays 15...gxh6, I have 16.Nxh6+ and mate would not be far off.  There are variations that would prevent it immediately, but checkmate would come sooner then later.
,However, the plan does not work, as Tom plays this to prevent that.
,Which left my DSB en-prise for real.  So, I defend.
,Tom wants to exchange.
,But, trying to trick Tom into getting his Queen away from the h file, where a similar plan could work, I attack it.
,However, it does not work, as Tom keeps his Q on the h file.
,Instead of exchanging, I take another pawn, and threaten a N fork against his Rooks.
,Not surprisingly, Tom prevents the fork.
,Although I could allow liquidation since it benefits white, I refuse the exchange.  As I am thinking that my other N could work.  And, two together could produce an overwhelming amount of pressure against Tom's King.  The real question how.
,I don't think it was necessary as it wasn't en-prise, but Tom adds another defender to his d7 pawn.
,This is where I'm thinking that the second N could be useful against Tom's King.
,But, Tom attacks it.
,And, I defend.
,This time, he forces an exchange, but I don't mind since it's also liquidation after remaining ahead.
,I am not exactly sure why Tom played this.  But, Jack Stockel now gets involved here.
,Thinking that I might now have a mate with the N sac, I ignore c7 and play this.  But, Jack was right to get really angry.  Almost yelling, he said, ""Why didn't you play 23.Bxc7! wins the pawn?"" 
, I said that I don't really need that pawn because I have a different plan.  Jack said, ""I am interested in what your plan is.""
,This, was my plan.  It was being this sac against his K.  I thought that when Tom takes back, I had a checkmate but didn't look at the variations carefully enough.
,Similar to what happened when I gave the wrong to a student whose no longer on this website, unfortunately, I thought that Tom's only move 25...Kh8 which leads to checkmate.  26.Bxf6+ Qg7 27.Qxg7#  But, I forgot an important lesson that Ken emphasized.  And, it's also something that fiercequeen mentioned in her first annotation that I commented on which is to relook at my variations.

"I started off with my usual.
,Although my coach has played the Sicilian, Karo Cann, and French Defenses, this is how he responds to my opening.  As I know, this is going to and does become the Ruy Lopez.
,I have seen Jack play 3...Bc5.  But, if he did that, I'd answer with 4.c3  Similar to what reversion mentioned in one of my annotations, GM Susan Polgar mentioned that it is a very common response.  As the idea is gaining tempo by attacking the B with that move, as the plan is 5.d4  So, it's what we call the c2-d4 plan since they're all aligned up.  But, Jack usually plays 3...a6, with which I respond with 4.Ba4.  But, he has also played the Berlin Wall, as Mr. Stockel did here.
,I used to answer with 4.Nc3  In fact, that was played in my game with tombulous since I thought he'd be too familiar with this move.  And, while there's nothing wrong with that move, reversion, said it's not quite as good as this move.  He said that, in general, it's best to stick with the mainlines.  While I agree with what Ken said which is that it's not the only thing to keep in mind.  I also agree with reversion's assessment because of what GM Susan Polgar outlined.  What she said is how I stopped trying different openings just because it's possible.  What Susan said is that what should be played is what you have the most experience with.  Although you have seen the other move, I feel the most comfortable with this move.  Of course 4...Nxe4 is a conditional move, as I'd quick play 5.Re1 
,But, Jack now decides to play this.
,So, I retreated.  But, after the game, Jack implied that this is inaccurate.  Here is a shocker.  He said that better was to capture immediately with 5.Bxc6  And, the reason is that with stronger players it's better to exchange just because it's possible.  When I'm not sure, I go by what he says.  But, as ION has said, ""Don't trust your opponent"".  And, I know that he is wrong in this case.  In fact, that's why I fell into a bad habit of exchanging whenever possible since he said that with Tom Levine.  However, Ken mentioned in our first training game that one should not exchange just because it was possible to do so.  And, refusing the exchanges is what helped him to win the game.  Although problematic still with exchanges, it got better.  That was mainly when I asked Susan Polgar when it's appropriate to exchange.  But, what Jack outlined is wrong.  That's because deeper_insight (TA) mentioned that, in this position, it's better not to exchange.  Instead, after ...a6, the best response is Ba4, and after ...b5, Bb3 is played.  On the other hand, after ...Na5 the exchange is forced, but it's better to exchange at that phase then it is at this stage.  So, I really go wrong is a later on.
,The idea is developing and preparing to castle.
,But, since I'm now in unfamiliar territory and don't where to go, I decide to start becoming a little aggressive.  The idea is to stay calm and collected when that happens because of how intense openings can be.  When this happens, getting nervous is the worst you can do as then the Fight or Flight Syndrome takes over.  Instead, this is where I apply what I learn in Yoga and just adjust.  The way to do is come up with a variation.  In this case, while it sounds unsound, I'm trying to see if there's a chance of winning Jack's Rh8 or Q.  If now 6...b5, 7.Bb3 would become a problem for that reason.
,But, Jack knows this and castles right away.  However, he would've played this, anyhow which is why he developed his DSB.
,So, I open up a line for my DSB.  I thought that this was better then fianchettoing it.  As I felt that it was more active here.  My plan is to somehow my N from g5, and instead, get the B there.  The idea is trying to put pressure against his Nf6.
,But, Jack attacks it first.
,And, he swarms in.  In most of the games that I've played, I just allow the opponent to exchange my Bb3 for the N.
,?? But, I wanted to try something different, as I wasn't ready to exchange.  Similar to what happened with Ken, I felt that there something that I could with my Bd5.  In this case, I felt that Jack was faced with a lot of pressure which in return made the position look difficult for me.  I felt that the only way for Jack to avoid losing a piece (R or B without compensation) was 9...f6  That was a conditional move with which I'd play 10.Bxf6+.  And, after 10...Rxf6 11.Bxf6+ Kxf6.  And, while everything seems even, given that I have a P and R for two minor pieces, I'd get an advantage.  As Jack's King would be exposed being that the weakest pawn is gone.  So, that's the only variation that came to mind.  In other words, it's the only that came into consideration.  But, as Ken and fiercequeen in one of her annotations, more needs to be considered.  In other words, I need to be thinking about more variations such as what happens next.  As that is what causes the oversights.  With that being said, this is where I really go wrong.   In fact, it is the losing blunder, as he is going to win a piece without compensation just like we saw in my second with Ken.  Much better was to leave the B on b3 and let him exchange.  As now, it's still even.  Not only that but, I might even benefit from that despite doubled pawns as it would be his N for my B.
,Not knowing what else to do, I decided to threaten mate.  The idea isn't mate, but with this move, I thought that everything would work out.  His next move was conditional as that's what I thought he'd play.  Jack could also play 10...h6 to stop the threat, with which, I'd answer with 11.Nxf7 (to remove the weakest pawn).  And, after 11...Rxf7 12.Qxe5 winning back a piece.  In the end, Jack would only be a pawn up.  But, my belief is that despite that, I'd get an initiative since my K is safer.  That was the logic behind this move as I had that variation in mind.
,But, Ken asked me the same question in one of the training games that Bonnie asked me in her annotation which is when I said that a certain move gives white two attackers against one defender.  And, fiercequeen asked, what if black played the R up.  And, I realized that a second defender would be added.  So, my assessment was wrong.  The same thing happened here.  It was off, as I had overlooked this being played, instead.  With that, there's nothing that I can do with my N because it is now gone.  It only get worse.
,?? Instead of asking myself what to do, I felt that I was safe here as it appeared to get material back.  What I forgot is that, first, I am still an entire piece down.  Second, this move gets me in another phase of trouble.  What I don't realize is that this move will cost me another piece.  Thus, it has now become a resignable position.  And, it was all caused by the oversights from just playing my moves, as opposed to, going through the variations.  But, I am not aware of what is to come.  It is afterwards that I figure out the consequences, in which I realize that it's too late to save the position.  Much better would've been 11.Nc3.  My idea was avoiding liquidation.  But, after 11...Bxc1, 12.Raxc1 or 12.Rfxc1, black was able to liquidate.  But, white hasn't lost any more material.  
,Not wanting to lose a piece, I figured that taking here prevented any further damage.  But, I was wrong, as I had overlooked what happens next.  Retreating wouldn't have prevented the next move, and had I play 12.Nc3 to prevent what comes, 13.fxg5 does the same thing as I can't take due to his Qd8.  So, no matter what I had played here, he as going to win another piece.  It was due to my faulty choice to play 11.Bxg5
,To prevent Jack from getting a R for free, I got the N out.  But, it's too little, too late.  He will get the equivalent to that.  
,The logic behind my previous comment was that I had considered retreating my Bg5 to prevent what happens next.  But, after 14...Nc2, Jack would've gotten a R and pawn without compensation.  But, getting the B afterwards, is the equivalent to that.  With that being said, although it is resignable, I'm not quite there yet.  But, I am almost ready to resign.  I figured that I'd play on a little more to see where I can go.  Not great for learning purposes.  However, it's similar to Hope Chess, so I'm hoping that Jack will make a mistake, somewhere, and allow me to draw.
,One reason for not resigning was my hope that Jack would blunder a pawn, and even allow me to renew a threat.

,a bit uncautious, considering Whites' next plan of action; better is Qc6, Nbd2, e6...
,we already left all charted territory; Black is trying to unbalance the game, but to no avail...
,overlooking Whites' next opportunity completely; best course of action is a6 (blocks Nb5), Bd3 (Nxf5?, Nxc3!, Nd6+, Qxd6), Nc6, 0-0, Nxd4, cxd4, or directly Nc6, Nb5, Qa5...
,no rocket science involved here: Nxg7+ is a nasty threat, and g6 does not work after Ng7+ and Bh6; after exf5, of course Qxd5... after Bf8, Nd6+, Bxd6, exd6...
,I liked this better than Nfd4; Black cannot afford Nxd5, exd5, Qxd5+...
,putting White in control...
,Black has not much choice left; after b6, Qd2, Ng6, Bxc5, bxc5, or Bxe3, fxe3, Ng6, White takes control with Qd6...
,Qb3, Rb8 leads to nothing; we need to keep Black occupied... after Rxf4, Qd2...
,after Rf8, Qe3! (0-0-0, b5!), Rxf3 is not of much use anymore; and after b5, simply Ncd2 is solving all problems... this is Blacks' last chance to unbalance Whites' game...
,now after b5, Nd6, Nxe5, 0-0-0...
,best here is b5, Nd6, Nxe5, 0-0-0, b4, Qd4, Bxd6, Qxd6, Qxd6, Rxd6, bxc3, bxc3, Nf7... now, Black is trading his only active piece at this point in development...
,a bit better is Qf6 (mainly preventing Qg5), f4, d5, Bh3, Qh6, 0-0, Bc5!, Qxc5, Qxh3...
,as was to be expected...
,not of real use is Qd2, d5, and Blacks' game is opening up... this is the only way, to stir up some attack; after Bxf2, Bd3!, Whites' development is suddenly completed and ready for a Kings' attack via Rg1, Bxg1, Rxg1, or Rd2, Bc5, Rg2... after d5 (the only option to guard g6), always Bd3; the Black King is getting into trouble, with both Kings' pawns under attack...
,not the best way to handle this; the safest way is Bd6, Kb1 (to get out of checks), g6, Rhg1, Qf7, h4, Bf4... this gives White an opportunity that cannot be missed...
,the threat Qe8 is too potent, to let just slip by; so black has to act... this gives White the opportunity to displace the Black pieces...

"Benko's opening.
,Reversed Alekhine Defense.

,Black generally does pretty well responding with d3.  While white's fianchettoed bishop throws some control over the center of the field, the pawn domination is stronger.

,Throwing the pawns into the field this way is a bit unusual.  The queen's pawn will be weak and is exchanged in just another two moves.  White's d3, while not bold, discourages e4 which would place a pile of pawns in white's white bishop's path.
,Time to see about pushing the queen around.
,Pe5 is undefended.
,Moving this pawn is generally pretty weak, but white's bishop cannot attack the black king's open diagonal without first moving three times, nor can the white queen move to h5 or h6 in under three moves.  Plus f6 discourages Nf3 opening an attack on Pb7, defended by Na5.  The drawback is that black's castle pawns are in disarray.  But that won't be an issue if the queens exchange.
,White's king ducks into the spider hole.

,Black just needs to deploy king side pieces, and can't move the bishop if the knight moves first.  White might have taken advantage of this with Nd2 (either one) Ne4, to attack d6.  The only other piece white could deploy against d6 is the queen, which is kind of blocked by hooves on a5.

,Probably should have done this instead of castling.
,Now black is defending the weak Bd6, and adding muscle to Pb7.
,It looks like a stupid move, and probably is.  But white's queen and rook share a diagonal, and whether or not Pd4 was ever played black needs support for Bb5 (which ultimately occurs on move 18--four moves away).

,Black cannot castle king's side.
,Bb5 no longer provides much attack.  I moved here primarily to block further advance of white's isolated b pawn.
,By attacking these pawns my hope is to drive white's pieces back to the back row.
,Here I noticed I could force Rd1 out, but I couldn't get more than swapping black bishops.  Whenever I played this out I'd drop a pawn.  I feel like I should be able to promote one of the right side pawns, but I never got anywhere--too easy for white to foil any advance it seemed.
,I decide to trade bishops.  I start out grabbing a pawn, but lose one later.  Still, should be able to force the passed pawn to promotion, theoretically.
,Pulling the bishop back preserves Pa6, and white has nothing to attack the black bishop.
,White blunders.  I think, ""hey, a pawn attacks one rook while the bishop another?""  White should probably trade rook for bishop with Rc2.
,This makes the blunder worse, trading down the rook for the pawn.

"I don't see the point behind this move.  Instead, I would've played 26.Rbd1.
,I also don't understand this move.
,I also don't know why Kanie played this.  I, at first, thought that it would be 27.Qh5+.  But, that was never going to be possible, even if the B moved due to blacks Nf6.
,But, this is what I thought getoverit was going to play earlier.  As he has a lot going on in the K side.
,Trying to stop it, Kanie attacks the Q.  But, this doesn't phase getoverit, at all.
,Kanie attempts to exchange pawns, as it looks nasty.  But, getoverit has a plan of his own.
,As this is the sac that I was talking about.
,?? Kanie took the bait.  I usually don't mark moves, but I believe that this is where white wrong.  I mean black did have an advantage, but this is the losing move, in my opinion because of what happens next.  And, yes, this is also where I saw the same type of pattern with GM Bobby Fischer when he played against GM Donald Byrne.  As Byrne brought his Q out early.  This allowed Fischer to sac his Q.  And, when Byrne took it, Fischer had a mating sequence which he took advantage and delivered a checkmate.
,With that being said, Kanie resigned here.  The idea being is that getoverit is going to capture g pawn.  No matter how white responds, black's next move would be 32...Qh2# which is checkmate.  The only despute to mating on h2 would be for white to move his Be2, but black still mates with 32...Qh1#

"But, Jack prevents that.  And, now, it is only a matter of time before I resign.
,And, it happened here.  In other words, this is where I resigned.  Similar to what happened in my second game with Ken, I am forced to liquidate Queens, in order to prevent Jack from winning my d5 pawn.  In the end, he said that I could have defended with 21.Nc3??.  But, that won't do, as he'd get my Queen, instead.  So, this is where I came to the realization that white's position is hopeless.  And, there's nothing else to get from continuing to play on.  When the game was over, Jack and I reviewed it.  He was almost enfuriated with my play here.  I can understand why, Mr. Stockel said that this was the one of the worst openings that he's ever seen from me.  So, we went to the beginning.  We even started a new game.  Unfortunately, he didn't go over it correctly since he said that it started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6  But, he played the Berlin Defense with 3...Nf6 followed by that moved.  And, he said that my losing blunder occurred right after he played ...Nd4.  Better was to just accept the exchange and get the DSB into play.  He was right there, as I miscalculated a variation and played a move that was easily countered, when I thought that I had pressure.  But, what my mentor said next, including the moral to this story is completely incorrect.  According to Jack, although not the losing blunder, I started going wrong by retreating with Ba4, instead of exchanging with Bxc6.   So, when we started a new game he made me play Bxc6 after ...a6.  Getting wrong on how this game went, we started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6.  But, we did not finish or get far with the game since Tom Levine came to play Jack.  With that comes his moral which is why I, for a long while, was in a bad habit of exchanging recklessly before the lesson with Ken.  As he said that the lesson to be learned is that when you're up against stronger opposition the idea is to exchange early and often.  By that, he means as much as possible, or doing so just because I can.  His logic is that stronger players want their pieces, so if you allow it, they become dangerous.  His moral, however, is wrong because of what Ken mentioned.  As the idea is that, in general, you might need those pieces later on.  So, just exchanging material without any thought is wrong on all levels.  And, as I know, Ken's correct.  With that being said, although I've reached the next level of seeing the board, what I must remember is to calculate the variations accurately.  That's what's needed to advance even further of good chess play.  What I forgot which Ken emphasized is that stronger players look at multiple variations, as opposed to, just one variation.  What I'm guilty of is only looking at one or two variations and thinking that they work which leads to oversights.  For example, I studied only one long set of variation when playing the blunderous 9.Bd5?? followed by 11.Bxg5?? which lost more material.  Although it didn't lose anything else, even 10.Qh5 was wrong because of how

"So, what comes to mind is the threat that TA called the N visualization count.  As I'm thinking, in the long term, of what to do with my N.  That's because, I might be able to come up with some nasty threats with it.
,What I overlooked was this move since my pawn is attacked.  The problem is that I didn't think it mattered because of what this mentor said when I took one of two doubled pawns before.  The best example was in the tournament game against Tom Walsh to which I should've lost.  And, that was when he was yelling at me, as we know, and later calming down and saying I shouldn't target those pawns because it's two bad pawn when I have a piece under attack.  This is when we were saying good bye to each other a week prior.  I kept that in mind and didn't think, he'd take.  The difference is that in the last game, as noted, it involved an attacked piece that was only defended once and attacked twice.  But, in this position, it's not attacked.  However, there is no way to defend c4 even if I wanted to which is also a problem with doubled pawns, in general.  That's because with connected pawns, one often defends another.   Therefore, I know he'll take but hold off for as long as possible with my next move, as his Rook will be attacked..
,But, he reattacks.  Doesn't bother me since the N is defended by the Bishop.
,So, I decide to centralize one of my Rooks, at once.  And, the reason that I used this Rook is that it will allow me to centralize the other Rooks because of where the center is located, as we know.
,But, now, the attack is a concern.  With the N there,  I need to defend.
,So, I get aggressive by trying to hold of his attack on my c pawn.  Therefore, I thought that the way to go was threatening an exchange.  As, I'm keeping in mind not to trust the opponent.  The good news here is that he did trust me with his next move.  That's because Jack thought that I'd exchange which I wasn't going to do.  Instead, I used what I call scare tactics to continue the idea of playing the man. 
,And, that's when I reattack his Rook which, not surprisingly, Jack defends.
,So, I intend to put pressure on Jack.  Although it is defended, I was trying to take advantage of Jack by making him think that N is under attack.  Not a good strategy, for once he moves it, my c pawn is gone.  But, when he takes it, I am decide to play something similar to Hope Chess because of what Ken mentioned in our training, when there was nothing else to los.
,The hope is that Jack will attack my Rook with ...b6, in which, I'd get a pawn back.  But, that plan is not going to work.  And, sure enough he will win another pawn.  So, it is a lost position.  All I can do is hope that Jack will go wrong.  That's because resignation is almost called for, but as it turns out, Jack will make mistakes which is going to allow me to win.  As noted in the intro Jack will do that for teaching purposes, as we'll see later on.
,Just as important is that my N was attacked.  And, this was the only way to defend it without losing material since I looked at 27.Bd2?? and even 27.Rb5??
,With that, Jack attacks again.
,So, I reattack.
,And, Jack is at it in a different form by threatening to liquidate my Be3 since I'm behind.  Not only is bad to accept for that reason, but the K side pawn structures would be destroyed which would put me at a further disadvantage.
,So, I refuse.
,So, if Jack can't get anything else, he threatens mate.  
,? I was tempted to try and defend with 30.f3??, but with his N on d1, I'd get mated in the same way.  Aside from that, this is the only other move that came into consideration.  As I didn't want to open up since it's not an endgame.  But, better was to open up with 30.g3, or 30.h3.  By playing this, my N is now semi cramped.  I should've kept it on b4, where it would have been better placed.
,This is why.  Had it stayed there, Jack would not have been able to win another pawn.  With what I played, he will get it.  This will, in return, leave me to an equivalent to a piece down.
,So, I try to hold off on that by attacking his Rook.  For when Jack defends, I will get my K into action.
,As now, Jack will continue attacks like this.  Of course, I keep his next move in mind, after which, I should be down by the equivalent without compensation.  
,Better was to take with the other Rook.  For after 32...Rcxc2, it would be about figuring out how to remove my Nd3 from that square.  As then, mate would become inevitable with a later ...Rf2#.

"Panic rather sets in. I need to get my Queen involved, while I have the initiative, but I leave my Bishop undefended. 15...Qd7 would have been better.
,Once again I'm a bit late with the right move.
,I'm still clinging to a fair position, but it could have been much better.
,Still, I can get back on level material terms now...
,White takes the sting out of my attack by exchanging.
,Then defends one loose pawn...
,Leaving me to snaffle up the other.
,This is more dangerous than I'd thought. I can defend the Bishop...
,As I do.
,I expected this attack on the Bishop's supporting pawn. But White would have been better attacking the Bishop itself with 23.Nd2 and my advantage rather withers away after 23...Bb6 24.Nxc4 bxc4 25.Rxc4
,I thought White wouldn't want to allow me a passed pawn by exchanging his Bishop on the long diagonal.
,But he does!
,Like me, White plays the right move a little late in the day.
,Getting ready to advance my passed pawn.
,Supporting my Bishop.
,White wants to win back his pawn, but this is not the best way to do it. He could simply take the pawn on c7 or play 27.Ne6 followed by 28.axb5 and 29.Rxa8 with probably a better game.
,White's last move allows me to get my c-pawn back into the game, so I will still have a dangerous passed pawn should White capture my Bishop and d-pawn.
,This is probably even better for me than the position I had before, since my passed pawn is supported.
,Now I have two passed pawns and feeling like the win is on the way.
,I get behind one of my passed pawns, as the books tell you. But this rather loses the advantage after 32.Rb4. 31...Ra2, pinning the Knight, followed by 32...c3 would have been much better!

"not surprisingly, this is evaluated as the strongest reply to e4, without thinking too much ahead; attack the pawn... the Alekhine defense...
,the idea behind the Alekhine defense, is to lure Whites' center pawns forward in order to be able to attack them more easily...
,or straightaway d6...
,the Flohr approach...
,preparing Bb4+ and a possible attack supported by both Knights; much sounder is d6, to open a diagonal for Bc8 and prepare Bg4... this will bury Bc8 for a very long time...

,after Nb6, d5, exd5, cxd5, Bb4+, Nc3, Ne7, d6, cxd6, exd6, Ned5, Qe2+, Kf8 is not nice; but better than this...

,or Nde7, Bd3, d6, Qb3, 0-0...
,preparing b4 somewhere in the future, while preventing Nb4; as long as Black has not played d6, we can virtualy play anything...
,d6, c5, dxc5, dxc5, Nd5 was still an option here...
,the last chance to play d6 has gone by: Bc8 is a lost piece; furthermore, this robs Black of the possibility to play Nd5...
,getting ready to harass the other Knight; we keep piling up complications...
,the Thinking Machine works in mysterious ways; better a6, to prevent more mayhem... Black is preparing Nd8, after b5...
,I liked this better than b5, Nd8, 0-0, f5; this is practically forcing f5...
,after f5, b5, Nd8, 0-0, Qe8, a4, White has a strong edge; but not more than that... this will get Black into trouble...
,opening a full scale attack on Blacks' Kings wing; also preparing Ng5...
,never argue with a chess machine; but f5, b5, Nd8, a4, Nb8, 0-0, Bd7 was much to be preferred over this... finally Bc8 would have had a purpose...
,maybe taking things too easy, in preparing a blunt a4, followed by b5 and c6, and crack open Blacks' Queens wing with something like Qxc7: straightaway h5, g5, b5, looks more promising; but Black has nothing...

"Ruy Lopez a.k.a. Spanish Opening; Morphy Defence.
,So far, pretty standard.  However, this knight development is a little off the modern beaten track.  I knew a correspondence player in this country who used to play this with the express purpose of continuing to d5 and exchanging on e7.  Otherwise I don't really know what theory lies behind this move.
,[?! - in future notes I'll be adding this type of punctuation].  Dubious, in view of what follows.  More circumspect were 8.d3 or 8.Re1.
,Now: ask yourself this question.  Is it safe for White to recapture on d4?  Has he a better option?
,[?] This recapture might look safe, but in fact is quite unplayable, as the sequel will show.  Better would have been 9.Nd5.
,No real choice, but...
,Now White is in the toils of a Noah's Ark Trap.  I happen to know that Joe is aware of the notion of the N.A.T. so I'm a little surprised to see him walk into this one!
,Trapping the bishop.  This 'trap' is a well known feature of the Ruy Lopez.
,[!] I give it this mark of approbation, as showing a determination to make the best of the disastrous situation facing White so early in the game.  
,[!?] This move is not without risks, ...Ne8 being safer.  
,[?] Rather better was 13.Qe4 or maybe 13.Qf3, attacking knight and rook both.  Black would have had to find 13...d5! to avoid the loss of either. E.g.: 14.Qe4 d5!  15.exd6 e.p. Qxd6 (threatening mate on h2) 16.Bf4 Qd7.  This would have led to a complicated tactical melee, favouring Black, for sure, but in the circumstances very welcome to White. 
,Less effective than it would have been a move ago, as the knight now has protection.  
,[?] Oversight ... or a sacrifice for attack?  
,[!]  Best.  If Black has anything for the slight material sacrifices, the onus is on him to show it!  In fact, objectively speaking White has the edge right now.  All the same the situation is complicated and combative - and the slugfest is just beginning!
,Natural and good.  But 16.cxb3 was also worth considering.
,Setting up an 'X-ray' attack against h2.  White had better beware!
,[!] Fine response!  
,[?!]  Obviously what White had in mind from his previous move, but Black would have had more to worry about after 18.Qc6!!    The idea is, of course, 18...Qxc6 19.Nxe7ch Kh8  20.Nxc6.  If instead 18...Qd8, then 19.Qxc8! Qxc8 {19...Qxd5 20.Qxg4}   20.Nxe7ch Kh8  21.Nxc8 Rxc8 21,Rxa6 with a fine game for White.
,[!?] OK, but now would not have been a bad time to chase off the g4-knight (19.h3).
,Now h2 comes under a closer assault.

,better Nc6, Nxc6, bxc6, b3, Qc7, f4, Nh6...

,I did not trust Qh5, gxf4, 0-0, Bg7, Bxf4, Qb6+!, Rf2, 0-0-0...

,again, after Qh5, gxf4, Bxf4, Qb6, Qg5, 0-0, Nb3, I could not see any progress... this pins g5, and the threat fxg5 forces Black to act...
,obviously trying to cover for Bg7, in the event of gxf4; but this is a bad move... best here is h4, Qg4, Bf8, or Rg8, 0-0-0, h4...

,after Nf3, gxf4, Bxf4, h4 (Qc7, Rae1), Qg4, f6, exf6, Qxf6, Rae1... so we play it in forward...
,after h4, Qg4, h3, g3, gxf4, Bxf4, f5, exf6, Qxf6, Re3, Black might consider b5; now, his position will fall apart swiftly...
,making the pressure on g5 unbearable; Black will lose both pawns after h4, Qg4, h3, Nxg5, hxg2, Rf2...
,forced, but winning; after Nxd4, Bxd4, Rh6, a3!, a5, f5, most of Blacks' illusions are over... after b4, Nxc6, Bxc6, cxb4, Bb5, Rd1, f5, exf6, Qxf6, f5...
,making matters worse; as we will soon learn, Qe8 is much needed...
,again, not the best; after Qxc6, Bd4, Rh6, Rf2, Rf8, Qh4 (remember that move), Qc7, Black is better prepared for f5...
,without Bd7 enforcing e6, this is winning instantly...
,after exf5, Rxf5, Black has nothing to hope for either...
,the move Black had overlooked; the only reply is f6 (to prevent Qg5+ and more mayhem), fxe6, Re8 (to control e6)... then White might consider Rxf6!, Bxf6, Qxf6, with after the much needed Qg7, the forcing Qxg7, Kxg7, Bd4+, Kg8, Bxh8, Kxh8, Bg6, Re7, Bxh5...
,other options for Re8 are b4, Bd4!, Bxd4 (forced, otherwise Bxe5, fxe5 (what else?), Rf7!), cxd4, Rh6, or g3, h3, Re8, or Qe7, Bb6 (against Qxe6?, Bd4, followed by Rxf6), Re8...
,another option for White - next to Rxf6, Bxf6, Qxf6 etc. - is Bd4, Bxd4+, cxd4, Rh6, Re3, Qe7, Rf5, Qa7 (attacking d4), Rxf6 etc, or else Rxh5...

,while my pawns look badly placed -- I could not see how white can take advantage ..
,The light Bishop still doesn't move !

,I realize now his blunder, and the fact I lost the chance to plan Nxd4, probably winning in the long run.

"I don't know its name, but it has not betrayed me yet. No danger in d5... but I never actually faced it. 
,I like myself this instead of c4, but I feel a little worried about...
,If white takes back with the pawn, it opens a nice attack on the dark squares. It will not damage white, but he'd have to play defensively. So I'd suggest Nxd4 instead. Of course, it lets the way open for e5-d5 from black's side. 
,Ok, I won't have played this one as white.
,? First weak move.
,I got rid of his Bpair, I still have strenght on the dark squares and the B, and white has to spend tempoes for developing, just as me. It's not ""his game"" anymore. 
,? Useless move, since I can ignore the threat due to the hanging R.
,? A ""Just developing"" move I hate. d5 would have been natural, but I didn't want to open the way for possible counterattack on the white squares.
,Making the threat on my B actual. 
,Another ""sgrunt"" move. The idea is to control Qg5, with some embarassement from my part.
,Now or never. He chooses...
,...to close the center, which makes my lsb a headache. Moreover, if I castle, my K will be naked. 
,? Not necessary. I though on f5, hoping in exf6, and the chanche to move my e pawn, even sacrifying it for the sake of activating my lsb. But I didn't dare: on a blitz, it was too risky. g7-Ba6 was another plan, but it only aimed to getting along, nothing more. 
,...g4 is a threat, as the N has no squares. And it grabs space, while my K is in the center, but well protected for the time being. 
,Easily preventing my threat. But now, his N is fixed. Of course, h5 was not possible. Qd8-Rg8 could be a nice idea.
,...but instead, I saw the weakness of d4, and played this in order to play b5 in order to prevent the N to go to a4, kicking my Q. Q and N will press d4, forcing white to defend. But...
,?? I overlooked here a tactic I would have certainly seen being the white player: Nc6 is undefended after Nxb5 or Nxd5. 
,? This makes only easier my task, since I can defend the N with the B and the Q won't take it. 
,Maybe a mistake. Bd7 was more in line with the idea of shielding my K in the center. But the idea was to play on d4, and if I get it, my d5 pawn will be able to move, aiming at his K.  
,Maybe the idea is to play b4 having a3 defended, but my idea was...

"? I thought that he would take back with the Queen which would certainly force another unwanted exchange.  But, with this move, I feel happy about him exchanging as this enables me to win a pawn by hitting his Queen.  
,?? But, this is an example of where to take is a mistake.  The only thing that came into consideration was the idea of winning his R for a N, in it's aftermath due to Tunnel Vision.  Of course, I kept the last move in mind but thought that I was winning material.  But, after I retreat, he takes with the N, instead of the Bishop, which is going to lose a piece, in return.  That leaves me the equivalent of a pawn down.  There is still hope though because with extra pawns on the board, I will need those endgames strategies more then anything else.
,The reason for this retreat was to avoid exchanging.
,And, Tom hit's my Queen, instead.
,So, I switch sides of the board to put pressure on his Q side, instead since his a2 is under fire.
,Which Tom protects.
,So, I hit his Queen.  Although it's not called this, it's the same idea as Hope Chess as I am hoping that Tom takes his Queen off of the fourth rank so that I can win back a pawn.  But, that is exactly what happened.
,?? Being fixated on exchanging pawns do to the Tunnel Vision, I overlooked that I could have won a piece for pawn with 22...Qxf4
,Not wanting to chance anything, Tom attacks my Queen.
,As now, he is going for an exchange
,Due to Ghost Vision, I inadvertently allowed the exchange, anyhow.  It appeared that Tom had a threat of the win of material of checkmate.  But, what happened here is that I, somehow, got my Queen mixed up with his Queen due to where my King was located.  To get out of trouble, I thought that this was necessary.  However, I was wrong here.  Had this not happened, it would've refused with 24...Bd4 since the reality is that it is protected by my Queen.  And, what I mean by reality here is if I didn't have that episode of Ghost Vision.
,I am not sure why Tom played this.
,But, what I remember is that passed pawns must be pushed.
,Maybe, Tom was worried about my K side.  But, I keep pushing my passed pawn since it is protected by my Ra8.
,But, I stopped here since it appeared that Tom had a threat.  More importantly, I remembered that when you find a good move look for something better.  So, I get that opportunity to win his B for two pawns with this upcoming fork.
,With that being said, this check does not bother me.
,At first, I didn't see the point behind this move.
,?? I thought Tom would try to stop this pawn with Rc4 followed by Rc1.  Somehow, I got a little nervous.  But, best was to continue pushing with 31...a3  With the move played, I just threw my advantage.
,As now, there is pressure against my K side.
,?? Which I thought that I had stopped, but this is the losing blunder because of what comes next.  Instead, I could've, at least, held a draw with 32...Rf7  But, it's all over for black now.

".La difesa Robatsch, nota anche come difesa moderna (ma da non confondere con la difesa moderna - Averbakh), è un'apertura degli scacchi caratterizzata dalle mosse:
1.e4 g6
2.d4 Ag7

Pregio e difetto di questa apertura è la estrema varietà e mutevolezza (anche nel nome). Prende il nome dallo scacchista austriaco Karl Robatsch.

Presenta alcune analogie con la difesa Pirc, ma, a differenza di questa, il cavallo g8 non viene subito sviluppato in f6, anzi molto spesso entra in gioco da h6 o da e7, proprio per non chiudere la diagonale dell'Ag7. Di regola il Bianco occupa tutto il centro con i pedoni, avanzando a volte anche il pedone f2 in f4. Il Nero deve reagire energicamente per non essere soffocato. Per molto tempo la difesa moderna è stata considerata una difesa irregolare e solo nella seconda metà del XX secolo è stata studiata estesamente e giocata a tutti i livelli: il contributo più significativo alla sua diffusione è stata opera di alcuni fortissimi GM inglesi.

Varianti

Alcune linee di gioco sono:
3.Cc3 c6 4.f4 d5 5.e5 h5 (variante Gurgenidze)
3.Cc3 d6 4.Cf3 c6 5.Ae2 Cd7 6.0-0 Dc7 7.a4 Cgf6 8.Ae3 0-0 9.Dd2 a5 10.h3 Cb6 11.Tfe1 Ad7 (variante Suttles)
3.Cf3 d6 4.c3 Cd7 5.Ae2 e6 6.0-0 Ce7 (variante dell'ippopotamo)
3.f4 (variante 3 pedoni 
.
.

Ho trovato una annotazione di Alekhine che, commentando la Partita Lasker-Capablanca, a proposito di 1. ... g6, ha scritto ""Secondo i fondamenti teorici attuali, questa mossa non può essere considerata del tutto valida, in quanto il nero si vincola ad una particolare posizione senza essere in alcun modo in grado di ostacolare lo sviluppo centrale dell'avversario...""
Ai giorni nostri 1... g6 (chiamata difesa Moderna) è ritenuta un'apertura del tutto accettabile.
Con 1. ... g6, il nero diversamente da quanto prospettato da Alekhine, non rinuncia alla possibilità di giocare al centro; attende invece che sia il bianco a compromettersi per primo centralmente. Normalmente il contro gioco del nero prevede sia ... c5 sia ... e5, benchè in alcune linee il nero giochi ... d5.
Nella difesa moderna il nero dispone di più strategie. Questa libertà aggiuntiva implica per il nero un'ulteriore responsabilità; quella di condurre l'azione centrale in modo tempestivo e opportuno.
Se il nero indugia eccessivamente permettendo al bianco di consolidare la sua mossa sul entro, allora incorrerà nella difficoltà menzionata da Alekhine, ossia quella di non riuscire in nessun modo a contrarstare il centro bianco.
(Fonte: John Nunn - Capire gli scacchi mossa dopo mossa) 
,Grazie per l'esposizione e per le riflessioni. (e grazie anche a Piero per l'intervento). Hai dato un'idea della flessibilità e varietà di soluzioni di questa apertura, che mi attrae al punto di volerla condividere con voi. Curioso che l'ampia carrellata di varianti proposta da Klaus non includa una mossa che trovo interessante: Ch3, dopo h4, con presa di possesso delle caselle f4 e g5 e preparazione ad un attacco sul lato di re. Tale attacco può essere un diversivo; una delle caratteristiche di questa difesa è quella di consentire al nero un rapido cambiamento di fronte, mediante mosse come b5-b4 e la mobilità della regina dopo c6 ed e6.
Per chi vuole approfondire, a me è piaciuto questo video: youtu.be. (In inglese)
Klaus, cominciamo con la Robatsch, dunque 1. e4 g6. Se prosegui con d4, io muovo Ag7.
,.
,.
,.Devo scegliere se occupare la casa c3 con il pedone o il cavallo. Giocando c3 si rinforza la casa d4 e si riduce l'attività dell'alfiere g7, ma si limita decisamente l'attività del cavallo b1, pertanto penso che questa mossa naturale sia la migliore al momento.
Ora mi aspetto il classico d6 per preparare c5 o e5. 
,.Fin qui tutto secondo standard. Ora però propongo una piccola variante, c6, che chiamerei ""variante Norwood"" dal nome del GM autore del video che vi ho proposto. Tale mossa mi piace perché consente sia l'opposizione al centro del bianco tramite d5, sia un futuro attacco dal lato di donna con b5. È nello spirito della difesa Robatsch, che privilegia gli attacchi sulle colonne laterali, e il controllo più che il possesso delle caselle chiave. Mi aspetto f4 da parte di Klaus, alla quale risponderei con d5, ma non escludo una più tranquilla mossa di sviluppo, o la ficcante Ac4. 
,.La mossa logica dopo la 4ª mossa del nero era Cf3. Ma questa la posso fare anche dopo quando, dopo Ch6 sposterà il suo alfiere campochiaro in g4.
Pe5 spegne, al momento, le velleità dell'alfiere camposcuro in g7 che è un po' il punto di forza di quest'apertura.
Ho trovato un commento su quest'apertura che rispecchia un po' le mie intenzioni (logicamente non sono così erudito da conoscere a menadito tutte le aperture e per questo cerco anch'io fonti che mi aiutino nell'analisi delle posizioni  )
""In questa partita il Nero opta per la chiusura del centro e mette su un vero e proprio ""catenaccio"" difensivo. Il Bianco con pazienza adotta una strategia di lento soffocamento prevenendo le possibilità di controgioco del Nero e cercando di guadagnare spazio sul lato di Donna, per poi lanciare l'attacco decisivo sul lato opposto."" 
,.
,.
,.Io ci provo io io io!! Secondo me stai già pensando ad un attacco basato su g4 e f5   in effetti questa variante della Robatsch consente sia al nero che al bianco di attaccare sulle colonne laterali, una volta bloccato il centro. A centro bloccato, il gioco diventa lento, strategico, e basato sul controllo delle caselle piuttosto che sul possesso. Perciò ci sta bene una mossa come h5, che prende possesso della casa g4, e prepara Ch6, Cf5 e Ag4. Quanto all'Ag7, ora è inattivo, ma dopo Ag4 ed e6, sfruttando lo ""slow chess"", si porterà in e7. Tutto questo Klaus permettendo   mi aspetto Cf3 o Ae3. 
,.
Cf3 o Ad3 sono ambedue buone mosse, ma poiché la prima e la più usata, mi fido di coloro che hanno fatto esperienza più di me  

h5 giocata da Stefano è una mossa contemplata e consigliata nell'apertura che stiamo giocando. Fino a quando non l'avrò capita un po' meglio, non rischio colpi di testa... a quello ci pensa Stefano  
D'altronde negli scacchi, o si forza l'avversario all'errore (ma in questo caso il fattore tempo, causa primaria, gioca poco a favore di qualcuno di noi in quanto non ci sono orologi) o si aspetta l'errore. Appunto...
Penso che per il nero al momento sia importante sviluppare l'apertura per permettere al proprio Re di arroccare. Anche Af5 non sarebbe male, per bilanciare un po' il possesso del centro senza spostare e5 che bloccherebbe il gioco dell'alfiere nero.
Ambedue le mosse si equivalono. Vediamo cosa decide Stefano. 
,.Rispondo con un'altra mossa tipica di questa apertura, che incrementa il controllo sulle caselle f5 e g4, e ribadisce il principio che il nero farà una subdola partita da rampicante sulle colonne a e h. Al ritorno di Klaus abbronzato, mi aspetto un'altra normale mossa di sviluppo tipo Ae3, e a quel punto penso che agiterò un po' le acque.
Quanto alle note di Klaus, ci sono varianti dell'apertura che non prevedono l'arrocco per il nero: infatti l'arrocco ha il difetto di spostare le torri dalla loro posizione di vasi per rampicanti...  . Af5 è interessante ma voglio ancora qualche mossa prima di decidere dove è meglio che vada l'alfiere. 
,.Come previsto da Stefano, gioco Ae3 che è una mossa contemplata nell'apertura e, con questa posizione sulla scacchiera, la più corretta.
Ora voglio vedere se Stefano indugia a bloccare la conquista del centro da parte dei miei pezzi.
Mi aspetto l'arrocco corto o, ancor meglio, una scalata nella verticali di lato tipo a5. Anche Db6 non sarebbe male, ma obiettivamente, anche se mette sotto stress il mio lato di donna, mi impensierisce poco in quanto con Tb1 la cosa è risolta. 
,.La casella e3 non è una buona destinazione per l'alfiere, perché io non muoverò certo g5 o c5 per liberarlo. Mi aspetto che in futuro si sposti in f2.
Quanto a me, è ora di far vedere la specialità della Robatsch: i cambi di lato. Comincio con Db6: una toccata sul lato di donna, che può essere facilmente parata con Ca4 o con Tb1, ma la mia regina è molto mobile, e lo sarà ancora di più dopo e6.
Tra le due mosse del bianco non so quale preferire: Ca4 guadagna un tempo che perderà quando giocherò b5, Tb1 è tranquilla ma distoglie la torre bianca dalla colonna del rampicante 😉 
,Ero indeciso tra Tb1 e Pb2. Ora Stefano inizierà l'atteso logoramento ai fianchi. pa5 potrebbe essere una possibilità, se prima non decide per l'arrocco. Anche Ag4, prontamente contrastato da il mio Ae2 potrebbe essere una continuazione interessante. 
Non sono un esperto di questa apertura e pertanto mi affido all'istinto e ad una elaborazione, più semplificata possibile, della situazione sulla scacchiera. Obiettivamente sono un po' privo di idee che potrebbero aiutarmi a sfondare le posizioni del nero, ma, come al solito, giocherò contenendo le sue velleità che, a mio parere, giocando sui fianchi, cercherà di destabilizzare la mia formazione al momento così così   (non sono soddisfatto)

,.Ho esaminato una possibilità interessante, Cg4. La variante è:
8. ... Cg4
9. Dd2 (per non rovinare l'arrocco) Cxe3
10. Dxe3
e a questo punto con Af4 costringo la regina bianca a muovere per la terza volta, mentre con Ag4 preludo a un apparentemente inevitabile impedonamento del bianco sulla colonna f (per salvare il pedone d4, mentre Ce2 perde il pedone a2). Davvero versatile la Robatsch!

Per lo scopo di questa partita, però, preferisco rimanere sul tracciato classico. Perciò gioco la rampicante mossa di sviluppo Ag4, alla quale il bianco risponderà con Ae2 per liberare la regina dal 'pin' 
.
Mi correggo anch'io
10. Dxe3 Ag4
11. Ae2 evita l'impedonamento 
,Stranamente non ho mai avuto paura delle impedonature. La cosa però, al momento, grazie alla mia solerte Donna, non è ancora in vista.
Avrei potuto giocare Ae2 e successivamente h3, ma ho l'impressione di perdere tempo. Gioco subito h3 per allontanare l'Alfiere in f5 o obbligarlo, come penso sarà  , allo scambio con il mio cavallino.
La mossa che mi infastidisce maggiormente è la possibile Cf5. Una posizione decisamente di predominanza per il nero che farà retrpcedere il mio Alfiere campo-scuro.
Forse qualcuno penserà che logica ci sia di giocare una partita dove i due avversari si comunicano le loro idee. Ricordo che stiamo solo cercando di far comprendere quali idee sobillino la mente di uno scacchista prima di muovere e che tutto questo epistolario è intentato solo a coinvolgere e, nel possibile, insegnare a qualche interessato i rudimenti principali di un'apertura e il conseguente medio-gioco. 
,Giustissima annotazione di Klaus, e io aggiungo: non fatevi remore a chiedere spiegazioni o a dare suggerimenti. Questa partita è soprattutto vostra. E poi magari mi evitate una delle mie cavolate!  

Ho esaminato l'ardita Cf5 subito, ma non si va oltre a un cambio nell'ordine naturale delle mosse. Se avessi di fronte un giocatore inesperto potrei provarla per vedere se il mio avversario, messo sotto pressione, commette un errore. Ma naturalmente non è il caso   e allora gioco subito AxCf3, che sarà seguita da DxAf3 e da Cf5.

Presumo che poi Klaus metterà al sicuro l'alfiere in f2, ma effettivamente il mio cavallo in f5 è in una posizione dominante. Il pedone d4 non è in pericolo, per ora; la variante:

11. Af2 Cxd4
12. Dd3 c5
13. Axd4 cxd4
14. Ce2 Db4+
15. c3 dxc3
15. bxc3

mantiene a stento il pedone guadagnato, a costo di pericolosissimi attacchi del bianco sulle colonne b e d. Pedone dunque avvelenato, ma senz'altro sotto pressione. E regina bianca tutta spostata sul lato di re...   E infine una situazione, a mio parere, fluida e tranquilla dalle parti del nero, con la possibilità di completare lo sviluppo con e6, Cd7, e qualche sorpresa. .
,Tutte mosse sensate e logiche che mostrano come questa apertura sia accativante per il nero. Effettivamente l'azione logorante ai fianchi, come presto succederà anche nel lato di donna, appaga le pretese del nero di far stagnare il gioco centrale a favore di logoranti incursioni laterali.
Cf5, come prospettato, è una mossa molto incisiva.
Non devo lasciare l'iniziativa a Stefano che, a quanto pare, conosce bene questa apertura che, sinceraente, io non ho mai usato, optando per la similare Pirc.
Le mosse prospettate da Stefano:

10. Dxf3 Cf5
11. Af2 Cxd4
12. Dd3 c5 mi vanno benissimo.
solo che a questo punto gioco 13. b4! .

"Not surprisingly, Sue attacks again.
,And, I defend again.
,? I presume that black wanted to put her N to a better outpost since I did mention that in the Deeper Chess Theory Club.  And, that was before reposting it in bhidragon's post about a 1700s study and a book by Bob Fischer about this.  But, it is Sue's first mistake as it will lose a pawn.  In fact, I said, ? I know that you wanted to get your N to a better spot since it is about getting your pieces to a better square. But, better was to leave your N on e7. In this position, it was better placed. As that was keeping your d5 pawn protected.
,? Not surprised to see my Q attacked.  Here, I gave advise but was a little off, as Sue will only lose a pawn and not a piece.  I did say that I will cost material, but I thought it was a pawn.  However, it was just one move that I overlooked which was 20...a5 since in all other variations, black loses a piece.  But, it was 20...a5 that I overlooked.  But, losing a pawn isn't completely off.  So, I was a little overly critical but not completely to say ?? I understand why you played this. As the Queen appears attacked. But, black has other options, like 19...Nb8, 19...Na7. I don't like it on a7 as well as it's on the rim. And, bringing back to b8 does undevelop, though from there, it can go to d7, followed by f6 with a nice position. However, best was 19...Ne7, as now I'm forced to retreat. And, from there, black 20...Nf5 where the N is well placed. But, this move, however, is going to lose more material.  Correcting a little bit of what I said, I reposted by saying,  Edit: 19...Nb8?? does not work as the Rook is not protected. But, better was 19...Na7, or 19...Ne7 However, for the reasons noted, 19...Ne7 was best. Therefore, it's actually would've been more accurate to post it as ? then an ?? move since it's nothing terrible. 
,The idea here is connecting her Rooks.  But, I would've played 21...Qb8 to prevent what's to come.  As that way, Sue would later be able to connect the Rooks without the Q being attacked.
,Calculating variations and thinking a little about what to do combined with memorizing some of the chess problems in her book about forks from, ""Tactics for Champions"", I decide to fork Sue's Qe6 and Ra8.  It ought to not be effective or work, but I am interested in what happens since the first thing she'll notice is the Queen being attacked.
,But, this is decisive mistake, and thus, the losing blunder.  Up until this point, although not an ideal position, black was fine.  With this move, black will lose the exchange, after which, it will go downhill.  So, I said ?? It is good that you realized that the Queen was attacked. However, 23.Nc7 was a forking move because your Ra8 was also attacked. Despite losing another pawn, 20...a5! was a good move and the only one in the sequence that I overlooked. But, in this position, with two pieces attacked, you could have defended both with 23...Qc8. As now, my N is pinned to the Queen. And, after something like 24.Bf4 Ra7 25.c3 Na6 26.Nxa6 Rxa6 27.Qxc8 Rxc8 white doesn't win anything else.  But, after that, I wasn't going to give any more advise because of what ION said.  And, that is not to critical when you have the winning advantage.  As up until this point, there was no clear winning initiative, even if white had an advantage.  That's so, but an advantage doesn't necessarily mean winning.  It's different, when one is more then a piece up.  And, after this game, I brought her back to this position and showed her how powerful the pin would've been.
,With my advantage, I centralize my Rook by attacking the Queen.  As this will pose as a potential threat on the eighth rank.
,Which becomes evident with this move, as I will exchange Rooks since the idea is liquidating when ahead.  And, that's why it is, in general, a win when you are up a piece or more.
,I could've taken on a5, but with this move, there will be a threat against the King is of even more importance since not only did 28.Qxa5 also come into consideration.  But, that was almost the move that I played, until I studied what's to come.
,Attacking my Bd8, and then some.
,That's because, as bad as it is, I almost made a terrible and obvious blunder being 29.Ng5?? to follow up on the 28.Qc4 which is why I didn't take on a5.  That's because as it will turn out later, the idea is that after Ng5, I'd follow up by capturing with the Queen on f7, and then h7 where it is mate.  And, it would be if Sue saw the threat and protected.  Or if she would overlooking it by taking the B since I'd be giving something back, and as a method, that's generally what you do when ahead.  However, mate is almost threatened, and with it, I, very nearly, overlooked 29...Qxh2#  That not only would've thrown away the advantage in a winning position.  But, as it is a teaching, Sue would not have learned, as then, she'd be able to pull a swindle.  And, the idea is that once you have advantage, if can be avoided, you don't want to give the student their advantage back, as Ken emphasized before our training sessions.  That is why I am upset with myself.  It's a good thing that I used analyze the board, but the bad part is that it got me spoiled since I overlooked a similar threat against Jack Stockel and got mated on the back rank.  The point is that before even using analyze the board, I should've seen the threat, rather then need to see what the opponent or in this case, the student was threatening.  Now, I could've protected with 29.g3, but when you see a good move, look for something better.  I thought that this was better since there is the added threat against the Queen, in which must be protected.  As now, g5 square won't be blocked which will allow me to play the same thing that would've lost with this move.  So, what I'm alluding is, indeed, 30.Ng5.
,As now, it will be difficult but not impossible to defend against the threat.  There is only move that will prevent mate, but I would keep the winning advantage.
,?? Not surprisingly, Sue attacks the N.  But, it doesn't defend against the threat.  Of course, I can take her Ng4 and be further up, but why do that when I can win the King.  For black, the only way to prevent mate was 30...Nh6, after which, I'd capture with 31.Bxa5.  Not only would be another pawn up, but it would be very difficult for Sue to defend her Nb4.  In fact, after that, I'd threaten, perhaps, mate again with something like Bb4 forcing further liquidation, and perhaps, a later Qc5 with Qe7 or Re1 in mind.  All of that would add more pressure to the King but would not mate at once.  With this move, I have it and will take advantage of that opportunity.
,Right after this game, is when I used the fen for right after 23.Nc7 and boiled it down to the moral of the story.  So, I said, you played very well in our game.  Your decisive mistake was overlooking a pin.   As you were down two pawns. But, had you played ...Qc8, my N would've been tied down with the pin. At that point, I wouldn't have been able to take your Rook. So, what you remember for the future is how powerful the pins can be. Sometimes, they're not a big deal. Or another way of looking at it is just a nuicanse. But, other times they can be very dangerous, so you want to ask yourself when it's serious or not. If you're not sure, it's better to assume that the pins can do a lot because that is true, more often then not.

"As per Sue's request, I started with this opening.  She wanted to go into a different variation of the Sicilian then what I'm used to for experience.
,As I am not used to seeing fianchettos this early in the Siclian.  Sure, I have seen it after 1...c5 but much later.  The only time I have seen this early was in the KID.  But, it shows how intense openings can be, especially if one is not careful.
,So, I play it normally, as if, it were the open variation since this pawn is always exchanged that way.
,I had expected 4...Nf6 to threaten the pawn.  But, it gets played later.  Believe it or not, I was ready to exchange here but declined in case of 5...Nf6 which gets played.  That's because exchanging would make it much more difficult for me to defend the center pawn.
,As this how I'm used to defending that pawn, especially in the Open Variation.  But, it works even in closed variations.
,Continuing with her development by completing the fianchetto.
,And, I continue with my development.
,Not surprisingly, Sue castles.
,But, I delay mine to strike at the center.
,As now, I can continue my development and might even be able to use this B pair, as I recently learned from GM Susan Polgar in the mega bundle course.
,Trying to exchange pawns.  This time, without considering anything else, I willing accept.  The reason for exchanging is that it will strengthen my Bf4 as it will have more mobility since it's not interfered by the very pawn that's coming off the board.
,Not knowing what else to do, and given that my development is complete, I castle here.   Better, however, was to defend with 11.Rb1 because of the threat against my b2 pawn. 
,Meanwhile, Sue completes her development.  But, as black, though, I would've taken the pawn.
,With d5 attacked once, I decide to attack again by centralizing my Nc3.  What I forgot while looking variations, even after 12...Bxb2 is that what I want would fail since the Rook is attacked.  So, I was thinking about 12...Bxb2 13.Nxd6 with the idea that it's even, but I forgot to ask myself what happens after losing the exchange to 13...Bxa1.  The issue is that I still do not look at enough variations, despite the first training game with Ken.  Which means that it's something I forget way too easily, and thus, needs work on as my thought process just isn't completely there which isn't good, especially when I'm training someone. 
,Sue tries to stop it with this move.  But, taking on b2 would've stopped.  It's still possible, even after what follows.
,But, I decide to add more pressure because as Ken told me during our training games, it's about to handle the pressure.  And, I got the idea from him since he kept adding pressure against me when I thought that it was all over.  As now, one of the threats is the b7 pawn, but there might be others later.  For example, taking attacks the Queen, and if ...Qe8, I can attack with something like Nd6.  So, there are some very interesting variations that come into this move.  The only thing, that I keep missing, though, is that my b2 pawn is hanging, and the pressure could fail if she wins that pawn.
,Not Surprisingly, Sue defends the pawn.  But, better was 13...Bxb2, in which attacking the Queen wouldn't work because of ...Qc8.
,But, with my LSB, I don't attack the Queen right since the N is now under siege.  This time, though, I am not concerned and gave it, for the first time, some thought.  That's because if after 14...Bxb2 15.Bxc6 Bxa1 16.Bxa8 Qxa8 17.Qxa1 white hasn't lost material, and is, in fact, a piece up with a better position since this variation involves liquidation, after the fact.  However, I should've been concerned and thought more about this earlier since black could've gotten a free pawn.  With this being said in the after math of this move, Sue makes the right choice by defending the N.  In fact, I said, which I seem to remember and hopefully just before this move.  But, I said that right now, black is fine. But, best for black would've been to take my e5 pawn. As then, you'd be a pawn up, even if I were to take back.
,In the aftermath, I take away the opportunity for black to get that pawn.
,My guess is that Sue figured out what opportunity, and thus, attacks my Bb5 which I will defend.

"trying to provoke weaknesses. Really at this point my idea was to tie black up defending pawns and then march my king in and win by queening. 
,Black is running out of reasonable moves. 
,The king is now quite active and the open g-file could give some nice attacking ideas as well. 
,(!?) getting active. This allows white to trade the f and h pawns for the b pawns and then just push the a pawn all the way home. The situation is quite bad for black though and maybe this incites white to try to protect. 
,Of course no Rf1 and suddenly defending passively. 
,The reason why white is willing to give up two pawns including an outside passer for two doubled pawns. Rook behind the pawn is a winning idea and here the rook in the dark square can never be attacked. The rest is a matter of technique. 
,Trying to set up a fortress. 
,This also cuts off the third rank so the king can never get active. 
,The point of the previous move but black is lost. 
,Black has very few tries here. 
,Trading rooks means white is just going to win all of the pawns and push the f-pawn to victory. If the bishop ever tries to defend then the pawn will queen.
,And black resigns. If they try to take the f-pawn then white can win with a rook and king vs a king. Very likely I didn't find the absolute best line in the endgame (one of my weaknesses) but it seems like a reasonable practical decision. One of the reasons that I like the Evan's gambit is that black's best defenses normally give back material and white can play even material with a better position or, as in this game, go into an endgame an exchange up.

"But, he attacks my N, instead.  That was one sign, in which, I figured out that my plan would work.  When something like this happens and he attacks, I give it to him, or as I'll apply with what Charles said in his annotation, the Greek Gift.  So, if it black takes, I get something worth more.
,Thus, I continue with my plan.  And, as anticipated, he takes.  In doing so, I not only get a Rook, but I'll win an additional piece for pawn.  This will put black to the equivalent of a piece behind.  That was the plan behind my unsound 15.Qh5+?? if plan A failed which it did.  Then, I worked on plan B.  However, it shouldn't have worked, as black could've left me behind by getting his Bd5 out of harm's way, earlier.  For example, 17...Rg8 which drives the Q back and allows him to get his Bd5 to safety.  In fact, something like that happened in a very recent game where I thought that I was winning my opponents Queen with the plan to pin it.  But, I overlooked that he would just take my N with his Queen, after which, I resigned as there was nothing else to learn.
,With that being said, I go right after Ted's e pawn, as I don't want it to become a passer.
,And, Ted protects it.
,So, I go right after his N.
,Instead of recapturing right away which allows the N to escape, I see the potential to pin and win.  Thus, I would get back the piece I lost earlier and go way ahead.
,But, Ted sees and runs away.
,So, I throw in the discover check by recapturing, at once.
,And, instead of giving up my pawn, I attack his N.  When Ted retreat...
,I plan to attack it again by advancing my b pawn.
,?? Seeing the plan Ted played this but missed something crucial.  As now, I've not only compensated, but I get back the piece that I lost and then some by remembering what ION said about short range tactics.
,?? As I saw what's coming.  Thus, by taking, I'll be a R and pawn up without compensation since black will be in check using the same short range tactics.  
,With that, I'd say that the position is pretty much resignable for Ted.  He can hope that I go wrong and stalemate him.  But, I've got ways to prevent, as I'm considered to be, perhaps, the strongest student in the chess club, according to Jack himself (which is why I get less time then everyonelse in the tournament and will likely give an even bigger handicap in the tourney.)  With that being said, I won't be giving Ted a chance of counterplay.
,I saw where he might try, though, as Ted has a passed pawn, and this is it.  I must be careful to prevent the possibility of him promoting.  That's why I'm bound to take it.
,Why I also say that the position is pretty much resignable is that there is one move that would've delayed me from taking this pawn.  That was 29...c5, but after 30.bxc5 that pawn would fall as I'd take on the following move.
,Bringing his K into action.
,But, using what I remember about pawn chains, I place Ted in check right away.  I think that better would've been 31.Rd5 to prevent his K from coming down as what happens.
,Meanwhile, I attempt to target his c7 or h7 pawns.
,I thought that this was a better way to do it.  I also ideas of promoting my f2, g2, or h2 pawns.  If I didn't fixate on that, I would've just played 33.Re7 right away which would get one of those pawns.
,Trying to get some compensation, Ted plays this.  As he is threatening three of my pawns.  I'm familiar with this pattern as I saw a similar example in the WTW consultation game between brigadecommander and stalhandske.  As I suggested a move that was bad, and stalhandske made me go by my suggestion and play that in her position so that I'd learn why it's bad.  Sure enough, as he would've won two pawns in a similar, and I'm keeping that in mind because I have not intention of allowing Ted to win back material.

"Anyway Im sidetracking for today's annotation, in the greetings. An aspect of my game I've been missing is generating threats with moves and the abuse of outposts and watching higher players play and comment their games makes you learn a thing or two. 

So todays game will demonstrate the use of an Outpost that generates checkmate threats and what happens when that threat is overlooked.
,Those who've seen some of my annotations might know I like to annotate to save games I want to save, and can be quite entertaining. Also why I like annotating here on gameknot, I rarely see nimsovich opening annotations by black. I have a few in my repertoire of annotations now but all with different lines. Thus why I like this opening.
,That all being said this game merits a save cause it was almost a perfect game (1 innacuracy and 1 mistake and my mistake was  because there was a stronger move to play).

White doesn't allow for my favorite Gambit here and I prefer the scandanavian defense with d5.
,Very rare that in multiple days time control I get an exchange on d5. 
,Natural opening moves done here. White tends to take different routes at this point. They can develop their other knight play either bishops or sometimes their c pawn tend to be the 4 pieces that will move.
,My opponent goes bd3 here and in the past when facing this I would always exchange lsb's here and let their queen come out. 
,This I stole from my recent internet viewings. I quite like letting white do the exchange and not letting his queen out. And if he wants to open my h file all the better. Nimso games where I get a queen side castle tend to go well for me. 
,And with c3 and his queen not out I can strike at the middle right away. Usually f6 would have to come at a safer time if lsb's were off the board and whites queen had roaming ability.
,And so white gives the open file but I guess h3 is to hinder rook exit somewhat. Although what I like about the opening of the h file is not to take the rook out necessarily but the threats this open file can give if white castles king side.
,In games where white has that nice pawn chain connected with c3 and black having played nc6 , blacks dsb has to be patient and might only be able to come in play when whites dsb comes in direct play.
,Discomfort the dsb and gain space for Knight also this was to invite dxf6 to undouble my pawns. But white doesn't want a nice Outpost for his Knight on d5.
,Here a little Knight dancing. I have to exchange a piece is my thought to gain maneuvering room.
,Looks like my opponent is going queen side castles also.
,Here I was gonna let him exchange the knights out originally
,But when he replied this I judged that letting him exchange wouldn't be good anymore and since he doesn't seem to want to exchange on f6 I don't mind tempting him with letting him open the file
,He didn't accept my generous double pawn offer :)
,And so now I can close the middle and look to lock up queen side and then castle.
,Final piece development for white before castling
,I played this to trick my opponent into not queen side castling hehe but also to get him to move the pawns into a lock up if he wants to queen side castle.
,I liked this response.

"With the b-pawn safe I can get my final piece out.
,I hadn't expected this, and in retrospect I wish I had got rid of this Bishop when I had the chance, leaving Black with a hole on g7. Better still was retreating to f4, attacking the undefended d-pawn.
,Instead of these options I go quite wrong. Interestingly, this would probably have been playable had the Black Knight still been on b8. But my caution in covering the b-pawn has given Black the chance to develop it, and he now has the chance to throw my game into disarray!
,Nasty, threatening to give me doubled, isolated f-pawns. But I see no way of avoiding them, since after 16.Nxe5 Bxg5 my Queen is threatened. I quite miss 17. f4 Bh6 18. Nf3 Qf6 19. Rbe1 Bd7 20. Ng5 Qd4+ 21. Kh2 Bf5, which is bad enough, but better than what follows...
,Wrong defence.
,Black gets my pawns in the required mess.
,I'm thinking only to protect my two helpless pawns, but this could have been disastrous.  If 18...Bxh3+ 19.Kxh3 (or I lose the Rook)Qxf3+ 20.Kh2 Re5 I'm in real trouble.
,Fortunately, Black misses this possibility too, and I get the chance for some very desperate defending...
,I'm in a mess, but it's a defendable one. Not as bad as I think.
,I'm planning on doubling up my Rooks behind that weak h-pawn, but driving the Rook away with 20.f4 was a better plan.
,Allowing the other Rook into the game. Black could have done this with 20...Bf4, forcing an exchange that would have benefitted him, but he's in control now anyway.
,I'm hoping he'll swap, but of course he won't...
,Instead driving my King into the corner and stopping me doubling the Rooks behind the h-pawn.
,Curiously missing a chance to line his big guns up against me with 22...Rh5
,Until I force him there! Curious how a move can be correct at one point and quite wrong a move or so later. I'm hoping to trap one of these big guns, but it's not going to happen.
,Adding to the h-pawn's defence. But placing my Queen on the open file is disastrous; after 24.Re8 and the forced exchange of my Rook on e1 I'm probably finished.
,Fortunately, Black goes for exchanging down a little too soon, missing the better chance.
,I can't afford a discovered check!
,At the very least I can undouble my pawns. However, Black might have been better keeping his Queen on the board.
,The King heads out, but it's going nowehere while my Rook controls the only open file. I've rather weathered the storm and am only a pawn down, and a Rook pawn at that. It could have been much worse. Usually this tiny advantage is enough for my opponent, but he's rather underestimated his lead. It's not going to be easy.

"Today in my quest of game annotation I continue my examination of games that I have played in the Evan's gambit. Unlike the first game that I played, this game was a closer affair with an interesting attack that lead to a winning endgame. Let's examine. 
,As normal with the Evan's gambit I will be making notes on what the computer (Komodo) says in these positions is the best move, focusing on what black should be doing on defense and what white should be doing on the attack. The usual caveat with machines not always understanding a position exists, however, machines tend to be quite good at concrete lines and tactics, which the Evan's gambit is full of. 
,Signifying the Evan's gambit. Black does not actually have to take this pawn, but if they don't they do fall back into a passive position with white gaining space and often an attack as well. 
,Also the best way to refute a gambit is to accept it. 
,One of the main ideas in the opening is to stop black from developing properly all while opening avenues for your pieces to attack. At some point the idea is that black will have to give back some material to stay in the game and at worst white will have an even endgame. That is the idea of course. Does not always happen that way. 
,The best move, keeping an eye on the e1 square for the future. 
,This is the variation I have been trying so far. It is a full 3 pawn sac if black wants. Check out another game I annotated if you would like to see how that might go. http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=62485
,The natural move, accepting another pawn and asking white what their idea is. 
,The full three pawn sacrifice, at least temporarily. Black can take on c3 and be up three pawns and down in development. Or they can start to develop but give white a strong center with many nice attacking chances. 
,Black chooses the latter idea and plays the natural looking d6 move. There are often ideas here of white playing e5 because d6 is now a target to attack, but if white can't figure out a way to do that then it opens up the light squared bishop and tries to control some important squares. 
,Here is the first important position of this game. Black has to decide how to unravel his pieces and there are a lot of possible lines for white to attack. White is still down a pawn, or course but is ready to begin an attack. The a5 bishop is controlling e1, so the rook can't come into there if white can open the center, and the threat of Qb3 is such that the c8 bishop is kind of stuck. Interesting position though, and one of the reasons I like the Evan's gambit. Lots of ways for black to go wrong. 
,Potentially getting ready to castle and developing. This move seems kind of odd to the eye, but Bf6 doesn't really work because it allows white to play e5 at the right moment with tempo and smash open the center with likely tactics to go along with it. 
,I think this is probably the best move in the position, though I did also consider Qb3 and some other normal looking development moves. This prevents black from castling here though because if 9..O-O then 10. Qh5 looks great, threatening mate on h7 and pressuring f7 as well. 10..h6 11. Nxf7 Rxf7 wins the exchange and keeps a very strong attack going. Of course black has to figure out how to deal with the pressure on f7 without castling.
,Defending f7. Take a minute and think what you should play. White clearly has a nice position. You could play Qb3 or Qh5 with extra pressure on f7 which is somewhat hard to meet nicely. You could just take on h7 with the knight, for the rook to move, and then repeat the position at material equality. You could just take on f7 anyway, giving two pieces for a pawn and a rook and then play Qh5 at the end to pick up the h7 pawn anyway. Not to mention some Ba3 developing move or e5 trying to smash open the middle. Consider what you'd play and we'll talk about it in a second.
,This is what I played. I thought it better than Qb3 because it have the option of taking with the queen instead of taking with the bishop if black doesn't meet this properly. I thought that if g3 then Qxh7 looked great and that I was likely to win an exchange in the worse case scenario. The computer likes Nxh7 here with the idea that 10. Nxh7 Rh8 11. Ng5 Rf8 12. Qh5 is the same but now black can't block with Ng6 so easily. if 12..Ng6 then Nxf7 Rxf7 Qxg6 (not possible right now because the h7 pawn would protect g6) and white is crashing through winning the exchange in a great position instead of in an unclear position. If you think another move works as well let me know in a comment. I'm always looking for interesting ideas in this opening. 
,(!?) pretty cool try by black here. In most of these lines I end up winning the exchange but taking on h7 with the knight and winning the rook for that knight. The real question is who is going to have the initiative after the dust settles and this idea opens up some nice squares for the black pieces and gives black a bit of activity. 
,Taking with the bishop allows him to trade the knight for the bishop and keep simplifying, which helps his cause. 
,(?!) My thought here was that I'm winning an exchange by force, but this allows black to complicate the matter needlessly. Better is to just play a developing move. 12. Nd2 or Bd2 is better (blocking the e1 square from the black bishop so the rook can open up against the king. Remember, material here is dead equal and white has a great attack going. Not that the h1 rook has moved they are not castling any time soon so slow playing is better. Winning exchanges is still a reasonable thing to do though. 
,Only move. If Rh1 then Bxc4 wins a piece with the pressure still going. 
,The computer prefers 13. Nxf6+ Qxf6 14. Ba3. My play on move 12 was to win the exchange and I didn't see anything better so I was still going for my plan.

"my personal setup for the Grand Prix Attack (GPA)... I prefer this over the closed Sicilian with Nc3, such as 1. e4 c5, 2. Nc3 d6, 3. f4, for many reasons, mainly concerning Nc6; after Nf6, we now have d3... the main object here is g3, Bg2, 0-0, and develop...
,Black has no better than an early d5, countered by e5, possibly followed by Bf5, Be2, e6, d3... this early outbreak gives White the advantage... 
,stage 1 completed; Whites' sights are on f7...
,better first a6, a4, Qc7, to avoid upcoming complications...
,better than Bxf3, Qxf3, 0-0, g4/Qg3!, and the GPA is rolling...
,always an important move, in this variation; it counters mainly Qb6, followed by c4 and check... after Qb6, Qc2, supporting e4, and eventually d4...
,a very bad moment to try and neutralize Bc4; Black had best in Qd6, Nb3, b6, Nh4, a5...
,better Nc6...
,whatever the solution may be, this is not it; better try Bc6, c4, bxc4, dxc4, Rb8, or Nc6, Nb3, c4, etcetera... c5 has to be utilized at some time...
,a nasty surprise...
,not better is g6, exd5, Rfe8, Qxe5, Qxe5, Nxe5, Bf5, g4...
,all forced, Black is running into trouble soon...
,the point of this small combination; White is winning at least some material, especially after Raf1...
,even worse for Black is gxf6, Nf5!, Qd8, Ne4!, followed by Bg7...
,Black is in big trouble; the rogue pawn d5 is the desperado killer here... best option is running from checks with Kh8, and sit things out...
,there it is: Black is losing a piece...
,simple, but lethal: considering the threat Ne7+, followed by Qxe5, Black has to play Nxd6, Nxd6, Rad8, N2e4, c4, losing the Q's Knight...
,or Qd8; this loses swiftly...
,after Kg7 or Kh8, follows Qxe5 and soon mate... best is to get it over with by Qxe7, dxe7, and pray for a quick and not too painful kill...
,the easy way out...

"Kanie starts off with the Queen's pawn openings.  I wasn't sure how getoverit was going to respond.
,But, once getoverit played this, I was pretty sure that it was going to be QG since that's a well known opening.  Of course, it could also become the Colle's Franketort System or the London System, along with other things.  But, the most common response is QG.
,The Slav Defense is also how I respond to the QG.
,Kanie develops a piece.
,As does getoverit.
,Opening up a line for his Bf1, as well as, establishing a solid pawn chain.  But, I would've opened up a similar line by fianchettoing with 4.g3.
,And, getoverit has the same idea in mind.  Similarly, I would've fianchetto'd with 4...g6.
,This is where, however, Kanie finachettos.  So, there's got to be something that I'm not seeing.  I just don't know what that is.
,Centralizing his N which is generally a good way to go about.
,Threatening to exchange.  So, my inference is that exchanging benefits Kanie here.
,That's why I'm not surprised to see getoverit place white in check.
,Not wanting to exchange B's, though, this is how Kanie gets out of check.  And, I would've done the same thing here.
,I don't see the point behind this move.  The only reason being is that it appears to weaken the King since getoverit has advanced his weakest pawn on the chess board, similar to what I see in TA's blitz Q sac.
,With that being said, I am not surprised to see Kanie castle here.  In fact, I like it because the K is safe here.
,But, getoverit, however, delays it by developing another piece.
,Taking advantage of his fianchetto by placing the B there.  I think along the same line when it comes to the fianchettos.
,This is where getoverit decides to castle, at once.
,Meanwhile, Kanie decides to kick the B.  It has to be for tempo gain, as well as, maintaining a semi open file, in the process.
,I think that Kanie is planning to attack again.  Although, white could've played 11.c5 right away.  But, by playing this first, the plan would be adding to the pawn chain.
,getovert decides to bring his Q into play, at once.

"THis. Now my R is trappedd, and only my N prevents its death. It seems easy for white to force me to give back the exchange after g4, but it comes that after that move I can answer with Rxf3, preparing my revenge on Ne5. Very tricky, but when you are at my level, on a blitz, it was still thrilling. Will I lose this possible high-win? Will I be able to... throw it away?

"Not surprisingly, Jack attacks my R.
,So, I counterattack.
,Trying to put pressure on me.  It does work a little, but there is not enough to change my next move, as I am not willing to exchange here.  That's because of what I noted earlier being that now, it's my N for his B.
,Thus, I attack.  When Jack defends...
,I attack again.  We will get into the same territory.  My goal is to get Jack's B off of the a3-f8 diagonal.  As then, I'd be able to fork with Ne7+ and win a R for N.  Jack doesn't allow that.  And, one of those variations involves exchanging a lot of pawns, btw.
,?? But, Jack made a terrible mistake by capturing that pawn.  As now, even if I could do it the fork isn't necessary, when I can get a piece for free.  Seeing the bad move, I immediately take his B on b4 to leave him a piece down, without anything in return.  As now, he'll really have to struggle.  But, being confident and expecting the unexpected is what help me to seize this opportunity as I have missed these kinds of opportunities too often.
,As I was threatening to win another pawn, Jack protected it.
,I wasn't sure of what to do, so I doubled up here based on Jack's advice to do that.  But, I think that better was 26.Nd5  The reason I didn't play that first was if I was to double up a move later the N would interfere with that.  However, it would also threaten 27.Ne7+ which would make it difficult to drive off.  Jack probably would've found the threat and responded.  But, that alone, would've been more pressure against his forces.
,I am not sure why Jack played this as mate was not immediately threatened.
,So, seeing that the pawn is blocked, I attack b5.
,Not surprisingly, Jack protects.
,And, that's when I attack his R.  Not surprisingly, he defends.
,But, it is an odd way.  This is Hope Chess.  Being a piece down, he is giving me another pawn.  What's bad is that I also considered 29.Rxb5?? which would lost immediately, in which case, the Hope would've worked.  And, it would become a WTW chess game where I got mated.  But, I saw what's going on, as I went wrong in a similar way with a team game.  I believe he gave me a pawn with the same type of threat.  By, overlooking his had two Rooks against one in a back rank.  So, when he captured, I resigned because recaptured is forced, with which, he would've mated me at once.  Knowing that, combined with comments from bhidragon about those basic threats, I figured out what Jack wants, and I put a stop to it.  However, that was not before considering 29.Ne7+ which is effective.  But, I asked myself the question about mobility.  Like if I could free my N, and then make a threat of my own.  I didn't see it any, and I wouldn't be able to do anything with right away.  For after Jack would get out of check, this threat would remain.  So, the move after is what I decided to play right away.  As GM Susan Polgar put it, I opened up a window to stop the threat.
,With which, he also opens up a window.  And, that's when I make a similar threat of my own.  But, I don't use the N as it just check and Jack gets out.  So, there's not much in the way of mobility.  However, by threatening with the R, instead, there is a great deal of mobility and it will be difficult for Jack to drive off the threat that's coming which at the time, I thought would be impossible.
,So, this is where it starts.  As I am threatening what I play next.  But, then would continue with something 32.Rxg7+ Kh8 33.Rh7+ Kg8 34.Rg7# which is mate.  
,This move doesn't appear to change anything, but it does.  As my threat is the same.  But, what I forgot is that Jack can and will defend with his 31st move which means that, not surprisingly, he saw this coming.  
,What's worth noting is that even though I'm no longer threatening checkmate, I have both of my Rooks on the seventh rank.  That is known to be very powerful.
,Jack's idea is to exchange.  Well, being a piece up, I don't hesitate to liquidate.  Even when exchanging doesn't work, the only time that I do just because it's possible occurs when I'm ahead.  As it is about liquidating.
,With that being said, I try to exchange again.
,But, just like with Ken, Jack refuses.

"Hey hey all! Good afternoon!
,Here's yet another nimso annotation hehe. This game gets quite hectic real fast. But the ending is worth keeping.
,Strongest reply
,Preferred d5. We all got our playstyles :)
,Ooooooo , takes and not advance, we are gonna have some exchanges this game it looks like
,Recapture
,Going nc3 right away can allow Queen takes pawn for a Wiley game or forces a queen retreat
,Pin+development
,Nc3 now forces a queen retreat, gaining some development tempo
,But I'm a gambler at heart! queen check! For the players who don't like tangled positions or don't want to risk a queen trade here. Retreating the queen back to d8 is playable
,It is best for white to block with queen here. Allowing him to develop lsb when black exchanges queens. As for me I love the games where opponent blocks with a piece.
,Exchange to double pawn him or gain the d4 pawn if he recaptures with queen.
,Opponent chooses double pawn.
,I reposition my queen to allow my e pawn some movement room
,Maybe I could've chosen a better square. His bishop develops with tempo on my queen.
,Maybe queen d7 was better. But I wanted my queen to be out still and have diagonals to the queen side. Was anticipating him to castle queen side.
,Opponent heads towards queen side castling. He's way more developed than me. But his structure makes it a bit easier to anticipate his moves.
,Told myself I can wait until he plays his Knight to b5 to castle. Until then it's time to bring my other pieces out.
,And so after his castle my dsb development he plays the Knight to b5 and I go with my castle.
,I'm thinking he played this because I don't have an lsb anymore.

"French Defence.  A long time favourite of mine in OTB play.
,Black's standard challenge to White's claim upon the centre.
,The Tarrasch variation, in my view the most difficult line for Black to meet.  Also popular are 3.Nc3 (Classical) and 3.e5 (Advance variation).
,[!?]  Guimard Variation.  This used to be my stock response to White's 3rd move, and  I had a lot of success with it, even against strong opposition.  I did not use it to initiate piece play by a central break ...e5, but to play lines more akin to Owen's Defence, combined with a slower breakout with ...f6.  The fact is, though, that there is a bit of a down side to 3...Nc6, in that it blocks the thematic ...c5 pawn break.  This was not helped by my clumsy handling of the line during the next few moves.
,Develops, and protects the d-pawn at the same time.
,Attacks e4, and induces the pawn's advance.
,Most circumspect and probably best, though it does make bit of a problem out of the c8-bishop.  5...Ne4 is possibly playable, but it is not a move I would be happy to contemplate in this type of position.
,Possibly the most 'natural' move is 6.c3, but for some reason, this knight move has long been regarded as the strongest.  Personally, I don't think there is all that much in it.
,This was a new move for me - not conceptually, as I  used to play it quite a lot, but never so early.  I don't think I'll be in such a mad rush to repeat this experiment.  Better would have been ...Be7 or ...f6.
,To keep the knight snug on b3.
,Afterwards I felt that this should have waited one more move, in favour of ...Be7.
,A good development that exploits Black inability to strike at it by ...a6.  The threat is to exchange at the moment White considers most propitious, and, apart from the unappealing ...Na7, Black can't do much about it.
,As White omitted to exchange on f6, an alternative well worth thinking about was 8...fxe5 9.dxe5 ... (9.Nxe5 Ncxe5 10.dxe5 c6 would have been great for Black) 9...Be7 10.Nbd4 Ndb8  11.0-0 0-0 12.c3 Bd7 and Black's game looks reasonable enough.
,[?] What was I thinking?!  The knight recapture simply had to be the better option.  I think I might have had the ...e5 break in mind, but that was never going to happen.
,The e-pawn is under attack - what can be done about it?  Maybe I ought to have carried on, for better or for worse, 11...e5!? 12.Bxc6 bxc6  13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.dxe5 Be7, but the position doesn't look very comfortable.  Another idea might have been 11...Re8  12.Bf4 Na7  13.Bd3 Nc6.  Instead, I tried to revivify my game - and redress my earlier mishandling -  with a pawn sacrifice.  Had I thought this through more, I might well have chosen differently.
,[!] This probably did not deserve to turn out as well as it did, but for the cost of a pawn, Black's pieces became very active.
,The move I expected, and probably best.  But White could have contemplated a an exchange sacrifice, here, with 13.Rxc6!? bxc6 14.Bxc6 Ra7 15.Ne5 ... with plenty of activity to offset the slight material imbalance.
,At the cost of a pawn, Black's game doesn't look so bad, now.  But a pawn's a pawn fo' a' tha'.
,14.c3 was a good alternative.
,?! Possibly 14...Bd6 ought to have been played first.

"Cagily giving nothing away, and keeping it tight.  Around now I was thinking that this game was going to end in a draw.  I felt that I could hold, but that winning chances for Black were approximately nil.
,Probing, but also with the idea of bringing the rook to the 5th rank (...Rg5), where it can probe more effectively by moving along the rank unimpeded by his own pawns and pieces.
,White has a similar idea, by the look!
,Had White played 29.Rh4, I had intended 29...h5.  Normally when defending with pawn(s) minus, I prefer to keep them right back on their own rank or maybe 'up one', where they are strongest and most easily defended.  But I felt that in this game that won't do.  The h-pawn will be used to try and break up White's K-side, or at least make them easier to blockade.  That will require its exchange it the right moment.  As it transpired, the career of the Black h-pawn was to take an unexpected turn, later on.
,Attacking c2, the weak spot...
,Good: defending from an active post.  White is still presenting few targets for Black to aim at.  For the moment, White is engaged in a close-order advance whilst Black tries to snipe at any target that presents itself.  Can White bash a way through?
,h2 is not much of a target in itself, but I simply didn't like the look of ...Rc6.  For the moment Black's minor pieces are busy closing off the central files, so choices remain limited.  
,Instead, the plausible-looking 31.g4 ... was met by 31...Nxf4ch!  If then 32.Rxf4(??) Bxf4 and, one way or another, Black wins a piece.  Not even the pin by 33.Rf2 will do in view of ...Rxh2ch.  White would have to play something like 32.Kh1 (instead of Rxf4), when after 32...Rc5, Black keeps the pawn.   However, Kf3 was possible.
,The knight had to move, of course, but why here, and not ...Nc5?  No reason, that I can see now: c5 would have been a much better square for the knight.  Fortunately I haven't much damaged Black's position.  All the same, it starts to look as though White is making progress.
,Closing up the Q-side and transforming the weakness at c2 into a strength at c4.  But there are downsides to this.  Is a bit harder (though not impossible, as you will see) for White to induce a serious weakness in Black's Q-side, which right now is very strong.  That tends to localise White's attack to the centre and K-side, where Black is well enough placed to meet it.
,Discouraging g4.
,Black tries to hamper the g4 advance.  Normally I prefer to keep the pawns back when I am defending with pawn(s) minus, to make them harder to attack.  That policy should probably have held good here, as well.  But I was looking to stymie White's majority once and for all if I could.
,Good move, Black can no longer hold up White's K-side.
,Making room for the rook to retreat.  The c5-square does not look at all like a salubrious accommodation for the rook, so I make another square available..
,That the immediate exchange by Black would have left White with two joined passed pawns unopposed by enemy pawns is less an issue than another file opening up that would probably be of more use to White.  This retreat is intended instead to induce the g-pawn to advance.
,There was no real likelihood of White taking on h5, which would have suited Black on account of the split pawns.
,? - During the game I felt sure this was a mistake, and the Gameknot Analysis Engine agrees.  The pawn become a weakness that Black's handier pieces, the knight in particular, can just about reach.  A new phase begins, with Black making a serious bid for the initiative.
,Immediately driving one rook into a passive position, as the h-pawn has to be defended.  During the sequel, the knight will conduct hit and run raids hither and thither, using this square as his base of operations.  
,Pulling the rook back into reserve.  Black will be shifting his attention to the centre, and, given the weak point at b3, the Q-side as well.  The threats won't amount to much, but, by inducing a reaction, enable Black to make some sort of progress.  Such at least was the hope.
,I am supposing White wanted to get the rook off the bishop's diagonal, and h1 placed the rooks a knight-fork apart (a possible ...Ng3 attacking both).    But the rook is also placed so as to defend the b3-pawn should it come under attack by the knight at c5 or d4.  For the moment, meanwhile, White's passed pawns are going nowhere.

,Non riesco a vedere il colossale vantaggio del bianco :/ d'altra parte, in queste situazioni, si vedono quei settecento punticini di differenza tra me e Klaus: nella capacità di analisi strategica. Vabbè, se vado incontro al disastro, lo farò da scacchista vero, o meglio, come quel capitano della cavalleria polacca che affrontò a sciabolate un panzer. Per la cronaca fece una brutta fine, ma salvò l'onore.

Mi aspettavo, peraltro, la manovra di Klaus per destabilizzare il centro, bloccato praticamente dall'inizio della partita. Ad ogni manovra verso il centro, però, può corrispondere una insidia sui lati; E questo il concetto base della Robatsch. Pertanto non gioco Ab4+, che avrebbe solo l'effetto di mettere il re bianco dove vuole già andare, cioè in d1 (per consentire Tc1 senza timori). Gioco Cb4; mi sembra una buona mossa, mette in presa il pedone a2, e consente la risposta Cxd5 a cxd5, mettendo il cavallo nero a fare il pedone supplente per tenere bloccato il centro, ma in una posizione insidiosa per il bianco, con il pedone f4 in presa. cxd5 mi sembra la risposta più logica da parte del bianco; De2, l'unica altra mossa che difende entrambi i pedoni a2 e c4, entrambi insidiati, non va affatto bene per il bianco, chi rischia fortemente di perdere il pedone g4. c5 porta a Cxa2, ma dopo Cb6 e Ta7 I pericoli per il nero mi sembrano finiti.

Successivamente, mi aspetto tentativi del bianco di giocare Tc1 per attaccare sulla colonna c (previ Rd1 e Ae3), ma sono pronto a contrastarli. .
,Sposto il mio Re per anticipare le cattive intenzioni del cavallino che, a quanto pare, ha voglia di galoppare, ma solo per divertimento. Se proprio aveva voglia di trottare, sarebbe stato meglio se andava a brucare in a7.
Forse Stefano ha ragione sul mio eccessivo ottimismo. Mi scuso per aver venduto l'orso prima di averlo nel sacco (lo diceva anche Trapattoni  ). Logicamente sono molto ottimista sulla mia attuale situazione sulla scacchiera. Resto convinto del ritardo del nero nel contrastare l'attacco al centro. Ora il Re nero deve cercare di togliersi dalla diagonale della sua Donna. L'alfiere in f2 pazientemente aspetta di balzare in b6, logicamente prima il Pd4 deve spostarsi.

A questo punto è facile notare, secondo il mio modesto giudizio, che l'arrocco lungo, che mi sembrava di aver prospettato alcune mosse fa, arebbe sicuramente aiutato Stefano.

Ora aspetto la mossa che avrebbe dovuto fare prima:

22. ... Rc8

Logicamente sposterò il mio pedone ariete in c5 e il cavallo tornerà in c6 (un tempo perso?) La sentenza ai posteri  .
,I pericoli menzionati da Klaus si concretizzano se il suo pedone d4 si sposta, dunque è mio interesse:
- non prendere con d5xc4, pena aprire la diagonale h1-a8 per la donna (brrrr) o la diagonale g1-a7 per l'alfiere (doppio brrrr)
- lasciare il mio cavallo in b4, in modo che se il bianco fa c4xd5, allora Cxd5 e 'pedone supplente' (e mia regina su colonna libera)
- contrastare l'avanzata del pedone c.
Perciò muovo b7-b6, e se la risposta è c5, allora scambio bxc e cxd (presumo) e poi Tb8 che mette in presa l'alfiere in b5 e protegge b6 dall'altro alfiere. .
,.Una mossa non contemplata da Stefano. Semplice semplice  
Il cavallino ha molto posto dove trottare. Non so esattamente quale sarâ la prossima mossa del nero. Ma qualsiasi essa sia, mi porterà ad aumentare il mio vantaggio. Voglio comunque farmi sorprendere dalle decisioni di Stefano 
,Acc.... questa mossa non l'avevo proprio considerata. E nonostante l'understatement di Klaus, è decisiva. Per salvare la posizione, dovrò sacrificare, secondo i miei calcoli, l'alfiere per un pedone. (E mi andrebbe già di lusso). Visti i chiari di luna, gioco Cc2, e comincio a pensare alla prossima partita didattica. Siciliana Najdorf con English Attack? .
,Consideriamo la situazione... leggermente brutta (per non usare altri eufemismi) per Stefano.
L'attuale posizione sulla scacchiera denota chiaramente che il gioco del nero è completamente bloccato. Ora Stefano, se vuole continuare a giocare (cosa che mi auguro faccia per appagare i sadici  ) deve limitare i danni bloccando la diagonale della mia regina con la sua spostando Db7. La mossa exd5, come lampante, costerebbe al nero la Torre (Dxe5+ e successivo DxTa8). Logicamente ora la mia armata non può fermarsi e continuerò`con Ah4+ che costerà un altro pedone al nero. Insomma, per il nero vedo... nero  .
,ì, Klaus, l'unica mossa che mi mantiene in vita è Db7. Ad Ah4+, rispondo Ae7. 
.
,Ho studiato tutte le mie possibilità di gioco e possibili continuazioni.

25. Ac6 Ce3+
26. Axe3 (una mossa per ritardare quanto il fato ha già deciso  )

25. Ah4+ Ae7
26. AxAe7 DxAe7
27. d6!

25. Ac6 Da6+
26. Rg1 e poi?

Insomma, sinceramente, vale la pena continuare? Se si, muovo Ac6. .

-------------------------------
Commento di Stefano
-------------------------------
Sono andato un pochino più avanti con 25. Ac6 Da6+ 26. Rg1 Tb8 e non mi pare che, dopo d6, ci sia il modo ragionevole di impedire che il pedone d vada a regina, con matto in poche mosse.

Perciò, stretta di mano e personale soddisfazione nel vedere Klaus felice per la vittoria, e nel constatare che stavolta ho perso strategicamente, senza commettere marchiani errori. Un passo avanti.

Se tornassi indietro... giocherei b5 prima di a5.

Sotto con la prossima! Siciliana Najdorf, la ""Cadillac"" delle aperture  
---------------------------------
Commento di Klaus
---------------------------------
Speravo che la partita durasse più a lungo, ma qualche mossa innovativa di Stefano ha accorciato le gambe alla partita.

Poiché, come è stato detto in precedenza, lo scopo finale di questi threads non è quello di vincere o perdere una partita, ma di interessare i più a scopo di insegnamento, penso che dovremmo in seguito evitare, almeno per la prima parte della partita, mosse non contemplate nella normale apertura.

Spero che i più abbiano capito come la partita Moderna-Robatch, pur portando come fine il logoramento ai lati della formazione bianca, sia facilmente contrastabile se il bianco blocca le iniziative del nero e mantiene solido il centro.

Certamente, se l'avessi giocata contro un GM o latri ossi duri, non sarei riuscito ad arrivare al finale giocato e, probabilmente mi avrebbe fatto fare la fine del topo, ma questa è un'altra storia  

Insegnamento: giochiamo aperture semplici se ci sentiamo più sicuri.

"This is the first sign of aggressivity from my opponent. Now, the planned Ne5 is just disastrous to f6, e5 etc. 
,It seems a loss of tempo, but if BxB, my open column will be an edge, compensating the bad bishop I'll have left.
,Definitely aggressive. I like that!
,The BN on f6 is the ticket to Ne5.
,My N is inmune, and if BxN, black loses a B for nothing. 
,Castling into the fire. But now I have the B on g3, and my plan is to remove the Nf6 in order to get the Q up there. Still, I sensed not h3 or h4 will be of real help, and tried the other way instead: 
,I dared to close the center, now I have to keep some possibility of life for my lsb on b5. I've not compromised my kingside, yet, so no real reason to keep the Qside static. I'm grabbing space, for sure. 
,Yes, my Q can be harassed. But his lsb is trapped in for a couple of moves, and the dsb is also far from my Q. 
,I though about this: no problem: my R are connected. My K is in the center, but safe... no no, it is not, since I have an echange going on on my d pawn...
,Ouch! My fault. A full exchange set, and I would have been safe. But I overlooked it. Now: Bh4 is not really working after Qd7 - the least. But do I want to keep the lsb or not? Sure, it will help him to break in on a5. But without the Bpair, I feel a little unarmed.
,Now, if d4, Rd1 seems possible (dxe6+, Ke2, Q defends, fxe6...)
,This instead. I want to play a4, in order to prevent black from get his B to a5, but I have no time. No choice: 
,He can't play a4 or b6.
,My lsb out and with tempo! Wow! I got something. Still, a4 here was deadly for me.
,If a4 now, BxB, axB, threatening b6 again was the best. But I overlooked the threat on b6, and I had ""an idea"". 
,...like swearing the danger in the center was gone. Big mistake. The other rook, maybe, but this one must keep the eye on d8, just in case of... did I forget?
,Very embarassing. BxB+ is looming... how can I neutralize it? the answer was given by my opponent when he played Bd7.
,Who cares about the central pawn? Quitting the Q from the d column reduces the pressure on my position. 
,Thank you, dearest.
,Now he wants to exchange Q. Otherwise, I lose my dsb. It seems he found a good way to defend! Now I saw a shadow of a combination, based on sacrifying the e5 pawn. A dangerous play.

"For now, it's against Jack, and I start with my usual.
,And, he plays something different then what I expect.  I am sure that the idea is also playing different openings that I haven't seen in some time to help me learn.  And, it boils down to the same thing that happened in my second game against Kenneth_fiore_3 and before with the moral being how intense openings can be.  On the other hand, I am very used to playing against the French Defense, so for now, we stick with mainlines.
,But, I did not know how to continue after exchanging, so I go back to what I know.  Therefore, I continue, as if, we're about to go into the Spanish Opening.  But, the only idea behind that is development.  Therefore, nothing else came into consideration.
,What I overlooked is the pin.
,But, it's not a problem as I simply break it.
,Not surprisingly, Jack continues with his development.
,So, I castle at once since this is what I enjoy doing, anyhow.
,Meanwhile, Jack continues with his development.
,And, I decide to continue to develop with this pin.
,Not surprisingly, he also breaks this way.  And, as Jack said, which I keep in mind on the fifth move, the most common way to break the pin is with the B.  The only time I'll ever give it more thought is when a piece is en-prise and needs to be defended.  That only happened in a team match, with which, I was lucky to get off with a draw.
,With that I complete my development.
,As does Jack by castling.
,I didn't know what else to do, so the decision was made to mobilize the Queen.  One idea being is getting the Rooks connected.  But, the other was putting my Queen on the same diagnol as my Be2, with the idea to put pressure on Jack's Nc6.
,That plan doesn't work since he uses it to attack my Q.
,So, I am, instead, planning to put pressure on the other given that my Q is on the same diagonal as my Bg5, instead. 
,Worried that his Nb4 is under attack, Jack tries to defend this way.
,But, I've got an answer since it is now attacked.
,Right after this move was played, Perry shows up.  So, up until now, I was against Jack.  But, that is going to change.  Even though there's no tournament game, Mr. Stockel wants all of his students to have a chance to play for learning purposes which is sensible.  And, what he told Perry is that it's even.  I agree.  It stays like this for now but will change shortly when the first mistake is made.  For one move only, Jack gave him advice.  I thought that this would go on and off, in which, it would turn into an OTB consultation game.  But, that didn't occur since Jack was busy studying the OTB tournament games.
,With that being said, I played this to either force Perry into having doubled pawns by exchanging on c6, or if he exchanged on e5, black would face a tremendous amount of pressure with Bg5.  However, this is where Jack gave Perry advice to exchange on e2, first by saying, ""Take the Bishop"".  He was wondering, and questioned it.  But, Jack told him just to take that way.  Then, after looking harder, he said, ""Ok, if you say it is the best move, it must be.""  And, he played 12...Bxe2  Even though I didn't say anything, I agree with Jack.  However, Jack was going to spend time on the tournament, and when the games were over, that's when he was going to give his post game analysis on what the player did wrong.  In fact, that's one reason that there are absolutes time controls, as well.  On top of getting used to it for the real deal with tournaments, having the restrictions, gives Jack time to analyze and give advice for the future.  As that way, you learn and improve.
,Not only did I consider taking back with the Q, but 13.Qxe2? was almost played.  What stopped me from doing that is the fact that my d4 pawn is hanging.  By capturing this way, it is protected.

"My opponent start with the standard Queens pawn opening.    
,Among so many popular response i picked Ng6. I was not a regular player of this opening though
,He advances e3 pawn that clears his LSB path and add a good defender to d4. (what's the name of this variation??)
,I continued with my plan and Bg7 in next move for castling and sending my king to safe zone.
,He also continue with the castling in mind i think.
,According to plan
,Nc3 prevent my f6 knight to come at e4 as i was planned. So, i hold castling and decided to add a defender for e4 square with pawn advancement to d5 which may passivate my Bishop at g7. Please suggest the best possible move at this point 
,I ignored blockage of my bishop movement at g7.
,The standard move to prevent my LSB to pin his knight at f3. It seems me a over protective move though
,This move is for supporting my next move of LSB at f5 and targeted his c2 pawn if there is any weakness he offers. 
,But he guessed my plan and prevent any advancement of Nc3 to b4 for targeting c2 pawn. 
,So i stick to my plan and castle. Please suggest the timing of castling is right or not ?? as  opponent may have chance of pawn storm towards king side and exploit it to lead a winging situation. 
,He finally develop his LSB to best available square d3 and further stop my plan of Ne5. So far he has no weakness to attack
,this move is for vacating h7 square for f6 Knight so that i activate my Bishop at g7 to some extent atleast.  
,I was most afraid (psychologically) of king side pawn storm as i loose many game by this. He sacrifice his king safety at the cost of a strong pawn advancement as it seems. Post game computer analysis at chess-dotcom suggest this is a inaccuracy though, with a slight advantage of  0.65 in favor of black. Dear reader please share your view
,I was with my plan and also this seems me a reasonable move in this type of attack to king side
,and his most awkward move for me. I think he tried to clear the path for f - pawn for a strong attack to my king side.
,So i think this is best response of Nh2. Also open queen path through diagonal upto h4
,As expected he accept pawn exchange.
,I take back pawn with Bishop keeping in mind to take his knight at h2. Although Chess-dotcom computer analysis prefer to take with knight and give a big advantage of 1.56 in favor of black.

"So I take the pawn.
,He takes back.
,And I get a second extra pawn. However with best play, black can get a pawn back.
,He keeps his queen active.
,I pin his knight.
,He protects it. I am surprised that at the moment, Fritz is giving a small advantage to white. I am not sure that Fritz really understands that with the open board his queen is boss, and I am going to struggle to tame her.
,This seems normal to me, pinning the knight again, but Fritz prefers Bd5+ or Nf3. Certainly I considered Bd5+
,This is the only way to save his knight.
,And this the only way to save my knight.
,And now his queen drops back, and I have a long think. What would you play here?
,Fritz gives 27. Bd5+ or 27. Nf3 with a microscopic edge (0.03) to white. I knew that queens and knights can sometimes work very well together, and I was confident of drawing the ending of knight, rook and pawn v queen, so I decided to take his knight and rook off, as my king is slightly exposed.
,He takes back.
,I take again.
,He recaptures. What would you play now?
,This is what I played, although Fritz prefers 29. Rf3 or g4, both with advantage to black.
,This is a mistake. I saw before making move 27 that 29. Qb2 won a pawn, but I thought I could still hold that. (Fritz give black as 1.15 up after Qb2!). Fritz also prefers 29. d5 with black now up 0.75
,Best move for white according to Fritz - but black still 0.55 up

,...on this one. White has to defend again, Qe2, and I can exchange at will, holding a decent position despite the white's pawns.
,Does he want to revenge against h7? I'd be a bad bargain!
,Much better was to take with the K, connecting R at once, and keeping the B on the good square. Now I would have needed much more time to study my developement. I got to be the undeveloped one... for a single pawn. 
,Thank you white, you gave me very important tempoes. Still, the best move here was castling. White has Bh5+, which is not dangerous now because of g6, but later on, it will make f6 weak. So I should have defended starting by castling instead. 
,Now Bf5 was called for. 
,? 
,...and now I am threatened of Bh5+, and still I played, foolishly...
,Now. It seems a losing move, because of Bh5+, and after g6, Rxf6+. But, after Kg7, what does white have other than two threatened pieces? So I realized what was a mistake had its tricky side. Now, what about Nxc6 instead, threatening the R? I could have well taken the B in h5 and if NxR, KxN and I have two pieces (and ugly pawns) against a R. Another game...
,? I understand he wants to defend, and maybe feared the complications. Now, both players have made positional mistakes, but surely my position is worse, and a pawn doesn't compensate, unless I can survive the storm. Now, this move is played to avoid Kg6 after Ng5+. It would lead my K to the first row, and h7 will fall... as everything. So I have to be ""creative"".

after the move Rg2, as you note, we will take the pawn on h5 with the knight 
on g3, discovering a check on the black king, after the king is forced to move 
out of check, we can take the queen, and black will probably resign.  ynwa77: Vore 21. Rg2
Sorry. I tought I already voted.
,?? The idea behind this move was to complete my development.  But, it is the final blunder.  As I overlooked what's about to happen.  Instead, I had to get my Queen out of harm's way.
,easy-win: Vote 22.Nxh5
You will notice that the queen cannot recapture the knight because of the rook 
pinning the queen to the king. Also that no other piece can be placed 
between the rook and the queen to break the pin. 
When/if the queen captures our rook, the king will capture the queen.  ynwa77: Vote 22. Nxh5
I agree with easy-win.  redfoxrising: SAME I vote for the same Nxh5 as it is protected due to the pin it is on the rim but in this case that is the best outpost for our N.  falcon67: I vote for Nxh5 as well.  knightider62: My vote Nxh5 Nxh5 is my vote also.  jkarp: I resign with the following note. I played quite well in the very beginning. But, I made some terrible oversights. One was a pawn being on the same line as the N and Queen which allowed the winning back of material. And, just as important is what I just overlooked given that my Queen is on the same line as the K and your R. That was probably Ghost Vision as I thought that the Queen was on a different line. But, you guys played very well after these terrible moves. GG.

,But, nothing stops Charles from completing his development.
,Like before, I don't know why ION played this. 
,Not knowing what else to do, I also would've played this to gain tempo.  But, ION has an exchange in mind, with which Charles accepts.  As white, I would not have accepted the exchange, but as we know, stronger players see things that we do not see.
,Not surprisingly, Charles is going for an open flank.
,And, ION puts a stop to that.
,Charles has a plan to reposition his Rd1-c1, where ION's c7 pawn will become a target.
,ION wants to exchange here as that would give his Ra8 more mobility.
,But, Charles refuses for now by targeting.  But, ION is going to exchange because it appears that white's b4 pawn is more mobile then black's c7 pawn. 
,Not to my surprise, ION advances his pawn here.  I think that the idea is lessoning or taking the weakness of the doubled pawns.  However, I'm not sure, but that is a speculation.
,It appears that Charles played this to bring his other Rook to a more mobile square.
,Redeploying his Bishop to a more active square and completing his development.  
,And, Charles answer is by targeting ION's b4 pawn.
,Of course, ION is going to let it go since that was a bad pawn, and thus, had no use.  Instead, the N isn't just worth more, but it is more powerful and mobile, in this position.
,As ION reserved this move.  In other words, it was a waiting move by him.
,As now, ION isn't just attacking the Queen, but he's also placing an attacking force against Charles monarch.  So, King safety might become an issue here which is why he was willing to give up another pawn.
,The pressure keeps piling up.

"the sequence 1. e4 c5, 2. f4 is usually classified under B21; Morra Gambit and relatives... this setup mostly leads to versatile play for white to counter most of Blacks' play; one of the main features is the absence of an early d4, to compromise c5...
,in the Sicilian, Blacks' main object is to conquer d5; but at this stage is too soon... 
,under normal circumstances, I would have played c3, to block Nb4/Nd4, followed by g3, Bg2, 0-0, and start developing... this one works better, since d7 is now on d5...

,not good is Qxb5, Nc3, Qb4, Ra4, c4, Rxb4, Bxb4, 0-0, Bxa5, d3!
,Black spent a lot of tempo on that one...
,with this last three Knight moves, White has compromised Blacks' center pawns... it is clear to see here, that after c3 and g4, Black loses the center to d4...

,White has a very tiny edge here; after Nd4, f5, h6, Rb1, Nb5, f6 white has the initiative...

"Therefore, I decide to attack his pawn.
,And, Jack attacks my N.
,So, I defend by leaving his pawn attacked.
,And, Jack attacks again.  But, like we saw earlier, I'm not concerned because this is a mistake.  As now, I will take his passed pawn.  When Mr. Stockel recaptures.
,I decide that enough is enough and go after his R.  Just as good and worth considering was 38.c3 to push the passed pawn.  The reason I say this is because what was played is the only move that I considered.   One thing to remember is even if no blunder is made, just like what Ken said, more then one move should be considered.  My idea was as noted earlier, not to overthink things.  But, as chesskingdom64 has said, ""There is always more then one to do something.""
,On the contrary, I might be just as good that I consider that here because this move would leave it attack.  By having my passed pawn on c2, it's protected by my Nb4.
,Thus, I plan to and will centralize the K.  With that being said, this was played to get the King into action.  The plan is to add another defender to my c pawn so that I can safely push my passed pawn.
,I'm not exactly sure why Jack played this, but I think that he has the same idea in mind.
,But, my K is now centralized.
,I anticipated this move.  But, Jack said, ""Ok.  Let's try this.""  The next move that I have in mind is what I play next.  Since it looks good because of this will establish a nice pawn chain.  And, given that I'm still a piece up, nothing else came into consideration here.  As similar to my game with teardrop34, I'm still asking myself if, as opposed to, why a move is good.  This is something that still needs work, as Jeremy mentioned.
,I also anticipated him playing this.  So, there was a variation that I was studying with 40...Kf5 which led to me checking on g4.  But, that is my next move, which was the plan.  As now, not only is the R attacked, but more importantly, my passed pawn is protected again by my K.  And, that leaves it free to maneuvere.  So, I was, specifically, thinking about mobility here.
,And, this check does not bother me.
,Better might have been 43.Kc3, with the idea being 44.Kb3  But, I didn't want to block the path of my passed pawn.  However, having the K on b3, would allow that pawn to break through even quicker.  This time, I did consider, but once again, the idea was to not overthink.  Unlike before, however, that was an incorrect assessment because it would not be overthinking.  Instead, it would be looking at other variations.
,As now, my c2 pawn is blocked again.  In other words, it's still protected but only if I keep where it is.  So, it's confined which I don't like.
,Therefore, I go right after his g7 pawn.
,And, Jack defends.  Of course, I kept that in mind and thought that he'd protect.  That is because of a different variation that becomes a reality on my next move.
,As my passer is, once again, free to maneuver.
,Similar to what we saw on Jack's 42nd move, I had also anticipated this being played.
,So, I bring the K to where it should've been several moves earlier.  As my c pawn will soon become free to move.
,So, Jack targets my f pawn.

"So, I start off with my usual.
,As does my coach.  What I know is that it's going to be a Spanish Opening because I know his style of play, all too well as he taught me the opening.  So, I stick with what I have the most experience with.
,?! I'm not surprised that Jack played this against me.
,But, I know to handle it because reversion told me that this is the best response as the plan becomes d2-d4.  The pawn chain is useful.  More importantly, however, is that white gains tempo by attacking black's Bc5.
,But, Jack took me by surprise with this move.  If this were played a move earlier, I would not be taken off guard.  It all goes to show just how intense openings can be.  That is, even the ones that you're most used to, as Ken emphasized in our second training game which was very educational. 
,Had Jack played ...a6 right after 3.Bb5, I would've retreated with Ba4.  But, since he attacked after my attack, I thought about the question that Ken asked me.  And, I decided to follow up on it.  His question was if instead of playing Ba4, would I, for once, consider exchanging on c6.  The answer is that with a normal Spanish Opening I have, until I found out that it doesn't accomplish what I thought it did.  Since the only purpose was doubled pawns.  However, Jack took me off guard by playing it later, so my response is also trying to take him off guard.  Therefore, I decided to make that capture, at once.  As I have a plan once he is force to take back, and it's based on the idea of playing 4.c3.
,That's right.  It's this move, as after we exchange, his Bc5 is attacked.  So, with this extra tempo, I could not be any happier.
,As I castle at once, whereas, Jack doesn't have either side ready to do that, yet.  That's the only thing, though, that makes me happy about my position.  That's because from an instructive dream, I have learned not to become too happy about the position.  As there are things that you might be missing from that.  Instead of being happy, ask yourself what to do.  Well, I did after 5.Bxc6, as I realized that after what you saw, I could castle.  And, that was the plan.
,What I overlooked is this nasty, given that my LSB has been removed from the board.  But, it does not bother me because I won't move my Queen.  And, in doing so, Jack won't be able to mess up my K side pawn structures which is where it is most important to prevent the doubled pawn, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar.  As keeping the K safe is vital.
,? As I complete my development.  I thought nothing of the exchange.  But, this is my first mistake because I overlooked that I'm gonna lose pawn.  As I forgot that by Jack exchanging, that same piece was defending the d4 pawn.  And, that defender is gonna be removed which is also something you don't want.  
,Thinking that I could get it back, I decide to go on the offense, by attacking Jack's DSB.  And, when he retreats...
,I complete my development, at once.  It's worth noting that I have a short range plan.
,I'm not sure why Jack played this.
,But, I follow up on my plan.  And, this was it as after retreating, I try to form a different attack.
,As I am asking myself if there is a way to win back what I had lost.  The N's there, and I'm asking myself what happens if we exchange.  It was later that I realized that there is nothing to win.  So, there is no point in exchanging here.
,Meanwhile, Jack castles.
,And, I attack again.
,And, I continue with my attack.  In other words, I am not relenting. 
,So, Jack defends.  But, rather then retreat with 16...Bh6, he gets his Q into action.  
,So, I reattack his B, as this will get back the pawn that I lost.  However, I overlooked a critical detail.

"Just like with 1.e4 openings, this is how Jack also opens.  So, I'll stick to my usual.  Now, I know him, and with it he'll play the QG, in which, I'll decline with the Slav Defense.
,I was a little surprised to see this played now, as I had expected 3.Nf3  But, I have learned to expect the unexpected.  Might not be the right approach, but the idea is not to be taken off guard by things that you're not used to because as Ken taught, openings can be intense.
,With that being, I stick with what I'm used.  As I'm holding off on developing my Nb8 because of the general guidelines on that N in QPO, being that I might be able to use the c pawn at a later time.
,Trying to put pressure on me.  To my knowing and concern it didn't work because it's not pinned.  
,?! Thus, finding it a nuicense and ignoring the pressure, I decide to fianchetto my Bf8 at once by not thinking about anything else.  In other words, nothing else came into consideration.  But, this is an inaccuracy because will get a favorable exchange which puts me at a disadvantage.  For one thing, he is exchanging, my N for his B.  As with most position, the N is, in general, more favorable, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar.  In fact, that's why when I asked her about exchanges, she said that as a general rule, you should exchange the N for B.  And, she also stressed it in the mega bundle course that I purchased which is, ""Polgar University 2017.""  This is everything that she is covering in the university where she is teaching chess.  So, by ignoring what's occurring, Jack will be able to get the exchange that Susan has mentioned.  Second, in the process, Mr. Stockel will be able to double up my pawns.  And, what's worse is that I'll be forced to recapture away from the center which is another benefit for white.  Better was to self impose the pin by advancing my e pawn, but then, Jack would still get the beneficial exchange.  Therefore, best was to retreat my Nf6.
,I don't mind this exchange as much, but I think that it still benefits Jack.
,As now, Jack not only has a good line for his Bf1, but in the process, this move gives him a solid pawn chain.
,Doing what I can to put a stop to it, I continued my development with the decision of pinning his Nc3.  And, it's a method of trying to figure out other options, in this position.
,Not surprisingly, Jack places me in check.
,And, I interpose with my other N to leave the option of castling open.
,However, I overlooked this move since, similarly, my Nc6 is pinned.  But, I've got an answer to that.
,I'm still not completely but am feeling more comfortable about my position due to his a pawn being cut off from the rest of his pawns.  In other words, we're talking about an isolated pawn.
,With that, I add an extra defender to my Nc6 by breaking the pin.  Afterall, if something is attacked twice, as I learned in a very lucky draw it's trouble, especially when one of the attackers is what the defended piece is pinned to.
,I was surprised to see Jack develop this way.  In this position, I had expected to see 11.Nf3 where the N appears a little better.  With that, I'm going to castle next with the idea of freeing up my Nc6.  However, I did not spend enough time to think about Jack's next exchange since it will, once again involve my N for B.  As noted, this is going to be beneficial.  Better was to delay it even longer with 11...Nb8.  And, now, if Jack is to exchange, it would be my B for his N which wouldn't be as bad, and in fact, for the reasons noted earlier, may even be beneficial for black.
,After attacking the Q, I now prepare to exchange Jack's Ne2.  The only reason is for the idea of taking away Jack's right to castle which for me is a good enough reason.  However, my assessment was wrong, as we're about to see.  Even though I accurately anticipate what's to happen, Jack will overlook a better move which would've increased his advantage.
,As noted, this was the only reason that I exchanged on e2.  But, Jack would've maintained castling and would've increased his advantage with 15.Qxe2.  With this capture, he's given a little.  And, with that, this is where I feel comfortable about my position, whereas, I wasn't comfortable before Jack captured with his K.  And, that's because my K is now safer then his monarch.
,With that being said, I connect my Rooks and prepare to check on g4 with a plan behind it.  And, these plans which turn out accurate is where I'm not comfortable but begin to feel happy about my position.  In fact, I almost smiled here.
,Jack intends to double up which is why he played.  But, nothing stops me from checking on g4, at this point.
,Believe it or not, I saw this move coming and am not bothered by it, at all.  As I am still very comfortable with my position.  And, this is not going to change, even after the decisive mistake.
,Advancing his pawn, as 19.hxg6 is a conditional move.  As, I'm not only ready but am more then happy to exchange here, as we're bound to see.

"Yes, I know, a loss of time... but there is little difference, this is part of my scheme anyway. 
,This fianchetto is good, in my opinion. It creates for me the need to be extremely careful about the removing of the d pawn (needed for exchanges in e5 to come). I played on it in this game. 
,Not passive, since it is part of my ""dream"" setup. Why try to push d4? It will just be ""make his game"". 
,If he can't force me to remove d4, I can play risky on the Kside (my standard plan is to castle Qside). 
,Now the option: Bh2, and if BxB nothing happens (I don't mind to lose the castling rights). Here I took my first ""risky move"". 
,After the exchanges, I can have some compensation for the tempo he will spend in taking my R. Not a precise idea, just a feeling.
,Critical moment. A lot of possible moves, too hard for me going through all them. 1) I move the R, and the fork trheat is still ""on"". But dxe3, and if I get the piece, exf2+. Scary. 2) I take one piece and let my R to be taken: exB, and if BxR, exc7, and the Q has to move. Enough? 3) I take the N, and if BxR, fxg7, threatening the R, say Rg8, Bh6. Enough? 4) Block the B's diagonal. With f3 (dxe3 still looks dangerous for me), 5) with e4, and finally 6) with Nf3. 
Very hard decision in a blitz.  
,I sac the pawn, but I avoid dxe3. Now I get to my op a way out from the fork, in a way: 
,I bet, here, that I will have compensatio for the R. 
,?? Damn, this was a great flare. dxc7 shoud have been played first!!!
,Gulp! Still, I can get out from this.
,...and now I can save the R. But... what are we here for? :-)
,Second critical moment. Now, he R will cost him Qxg7, a ferocious attack (I can only see the f7 pawn's weakness...)
,Black prefers this to Rf8, Bh6, Kd7. 
,Can someone remove my c2 pawn from the board, please? To remove one's piece would be cheating? :-D. Now, seriously. I considered Qxe6, but there is nothing to counter Re8. I considered the ""emergency plan"" Qc8+, QxQ, dxQ, being defended by my lsb. Moreover, I'd have to take care of Rf8, and if my Q moves, RxB. 
,This makes possible qxe6, threats the B, and a possible R ride to c3. But does nothing against Rf8.
,With the lsb, it would have been a thematic mate net (after d7+). Can I make it work without it?
,This makes Qd5+ possible. Qe8 is not possible right now, but it must be kept in mind.
,? Qd5+ was much better, with Re1-Re8 in mind, but hey, Rc7 and I can't lose my pawn...
,Ready for Qe8!

"up until recently, I always looked down upon c4 as a false move in this Sicilian setup, Hungarian style; in my opinion, Bf1 would always be hindered in its development, making e4 in fact a redundant move... this game however learned me, this setup is part of the English Party, a flank opening usually enforced by Nc3... this move always induces a closed Sicilian; we need to work this out for the future...
,at this level of play, I learned not to trust dxc5, Qa5+ anymore... the upcoming Nc3, will always force d6; so we better prepare for that...
,in this variation, there is no time for playing e6, Ne7, 0-0, to prepare d5... after e6, Nc3, Ne7, the threat of Nb5 poses too much problems... so we need to switch plans...
,instead of Bf3, 0-0, 0-0... White is switching to an English setup...
,not clear, what White is planning here... b4, Na4, Nd5, looks much better...
,so far, so good...
,better first Qf2, looks much better; now, e4 will become a target after e5, somewhere followed by Bc6...
,after fxe5, Nxe5, also attacking c4 and Bd3...
,the best move; after Bc6, we need Nd5...
,clever move, if I may say so myself; after Bc6, Nd5, Bxd5, exd5, Black isn't getting anywhere soon, and f5 looks drafty... this move hinders a direct Nd5, due to Bxe3+, Qxe3, Ne5, and White is getting in all sorts of trouble... now, Qf2 is practically forced, upon which Black can choose from either Ne5 (also covering f7) or directly Bc6, putting e4 to the test; after Qf2, Bc6 (or first Bxe3+), Nd5, Bxd5, f7 is also (temporarily) covered...
,still better than Qf2, Bc6, after a closer look...
,somewhat better seems maybe Nxe3, Qh4! (Qg5, Rf3, Ne5, Rg3), Rc3 (against Ne5), Bc6...
,the object is simple: Bxd5, or after Nc3/Nf4, Ne5... a direct Ne5?, fails on Nf6+
,unclear what White is up to here; apart from Nc3/Nf4, the only other option to keep things together was Qf2: then, after trading on d5, Ne5 is forced; that way White may create play after c5... this move is getting Whites' Queen too far from the action...
,instead, Blacks' play is opening up; after exd5 (better not cxd5, considering Blacks' next move), Qb6+ (another reason for 22. Qf2), Kh1, e.g. Qxb4...
,not much difference makes cxd5, Qb6+...
,after c5, dxc5, Kh1 (Qf4, cxb4+, Kh1, f6!), cxb4, with roughly the same result...
,the main threat being of course Nxd3 (which can be countered by Qf4) and Qxb4; after Qd2 - to cover for both Bd3 and b4 - follows Qd4, Rd1, Qxd3, Qxd3, Nxd3, Rxd3, Rxc4...
,better was Qf4, to prevent Nxd3?, Qxf2+, Kh8, Qf6+, Kg8, and the game is drawn in perpetual check...
,stronger is Qa5 or Qa3, to prevent both Rb2 and Qd2... but is of no matter anymore; Bd3 is getting into trouble......

"White intends to get a better outpost with his N.
,So, I try to distract him by attacking it.
,And, I am certain that it will work.  The plan behind the distraction is preventing Carl from getting a good outpost with his N.  Had it not worked, 22.Ng3 would've been played, but he is also starting to feel pressure with the time.
,So, I sit back and wait just in case the opportunity to attack resumes.
,And, it does again.
,After which, he defends.  But, that does not bother me because the plan worked.  As now, I will happily exchange, so that white can't do anything else with his N.  And, in this position, with only doubled pawns as an asset, white's advantage is gone.  And, with only 5 minutes remaining, I am, at this point, 100% confident that he won't be able to take advantage of my doubled.  Therefore, I have, ultimately, gotten myself out of trouble, that I got myself into with carelessness.
,Given that we're now in the endgame, I start using my K as a weapon.
,And, white advances his pawn, as this gives him a solid pawn chain.
,So, I race right over to the c file with my K.
,Trying to support his pawns.
,But, I don't care, at this point, given that time is almost with only about 2 minutes left.  So, I form a pawn chain of my own.
,And, he tries to race over to that file.
,But, I put a stop to that by making it impossible for white to play Kg4 which I believe was his intention.
,I'm not sure why this was played.
,But, I'm not worried about that.  As this move was played to ensure better mobility for my DSB where it now covers more squares.
,This is when I figured out white's goal.  The idea is trying to get a passed pawn.
,Like before, I put a stop to that.
,So, Carl brings an extra defender to stop me.  Now, if time weren't just about out, this would be lost.  But, I knew for a while, as previously mentioned that it would happen.
,As it did here.  And, with me having to leave to get ready for work, the game was declared unfinished which is how we leave it.  In other words, we will not be continuing this game at a later time, as some of you are used to.  Yet, it's not declared a win or loss since there wasn't enough time for white to win.   Therefore, my way of calling it unfinished is still in progress, but you can call it, from another perspective, a draw since we won't be going back to this game.  Meanwhile, I'm gonna have to work on playing better when time is of the essence.  I have improved though because the week after this game was played, I played another tournament game.  With a bigger handicap, I had only 20 min. against his 55 min.  I took my time, and thus, almost timed out.  But, with a better position, I was able to force the win, regardless.  I'll have to remember how I did that and not let the time crunch get to me.  For, if there was time to finish, I would've lost, with best play.

"This was a part of the plan behind the exchange as I now have an attacker against the Q.  When Ted defends...
,I attack again.  And, this is where I thought that exchanging automatically wins a pawn.  What I forgot is that it shouldn't achieve the goal.  Thus, my variation and assessment was incorrect.  I was thinking about what occurs.  His next move was also planned.
,? But, had Ted played 20.Rc8 the plan behind exchanging would have failed as now he would have had another defender to equal my attackers.  By taking right away, which I anticipated knowing him, white winds up a pawn down.
,I don't know why Ted played this as this blocks his B.
,That allows me to go right after his b pawn.
,But, by playing this move, I think I've got something better.  As I believe that when you see a good move, you should look for something better.  Although, I do like just playing the good move which would've been to grab the b pawn.  However, I thought that black might just have an immediate win here.  So, I try with my next move.
,Being that Ted was forced onto the second rank with his K.
,And, I prepare to deliver another nasty check.
,I guess the idea was trying to get the B to a better spot.  But, I can and will check again which forces white's K onto the first rank.
,I am not surprised that Ted attacked the R.  But, I will now grab his f2 pawn.
,I guess he's prepared for a check.  But, that doesn't bother me.
,As now, I can do a lot with my DSB.  A small part is the R being attacked.  But, I also might have a check mate.
,And, this is when Jack gets involved after finishing his training game with Mariann.  I am not happy that he made this move.  As now, not only can I win, but as usual, by doing this, he distracted me as well as Ted.  I didn't know what Ted was going to do, and then all of a sudden, Jack played this for white.  That distraction became terrible, as you're about to see.  It won't change the plan, but it causes me to overlook something else which turned into a bad move, similar to what you saw in my first training game with Mariann where I coached her, as per Ken's comment.  That was when I failed to take a piece but took a pawn, instead.  The intention was to protect the B, but I don't need the B when I've got something better.  But, as noted, I missed the opportunity.
,?? I had this sac in mind.  In other words, I decide to give up my Rf2.  But, had I not been distracted, I would've seen it.  I asked myself about the point behind 29...Rb1+, as I didn't see much after 30.Rc1.  Well, there was, and this is where the distraction took over as I was thinking even exchange and doesn't achieve much.  Whereas, the promotion is a killer.  But, due to my Bh6, 30...Rc1# is checkmate.  In the future, I wish that Jack Stockel wouldn't just move or change things around as that's how I overlook these things since I consider it extremely distracting.
,But, Jack said that it's lost, and Ted resigned.  I agreed with Jack.  The plan behind the R sac for this move is that I was planning something like 31...Ra6 and after 32.Ra2, I'd have 32...b6.  And, I keep using those pawns chains one by one where each advances one square until I've promoted.  But, I forgot that after 33.Bf1, I'm now forced to retreat.  In fact, he could even stop those variations with 31.Bf1.  After which, even after moving my R and playing something like a later ...b6, he has Ra2.  The only thing that would help is ...Rd5+, but Ted can block with something like Rd2.  And, in some of these variations he would have an advantage.  Ted and I just didn't realize due to the distractions.  But, Jack then said that after 27...Bh7, white was hopeless.  It's true, and I don't even mind him watching or commenting after the game to coach us.  But, what I didn't enjoy was him getting involved and changing things around before the end of game.  I guess it is good practice.  And, what I've got to learn and get better is knowing how to overcome these distractions.  As that way, I won't miss something like 29...Rb1+ which would've mated, at once.

"Jeremy starts off with his usual.
,I know Charles style of play.  And, he enjoys playing the Grunfeld Defense.  In fact, a lot of his annotations that I've studied involves that.
,So, Jeremy gets aggressive.  The idea being is that, in general, passive play does not work against a strong opponent.  Although, Jeremy's rating is higher, I don't blame for not taking chances.  And, that's due to the fact that Charles was able to outplay Janet in a game that I annotated about a month ago.
,So, Charles returns the favor by attacking Jeremy's Bishop.
,As now, Charles intends to exchange pawns.  At first, I wasn't sure why since Jeremy's pawn isn't in the center.  However, the purpose is to leave black with doubled pawns.  As two bad pawns, in many cases, can be close to as bad as losing a pawn which is something that GM Susan Polgar implied.  As she said that pawn structures are, in general, very important.
,Therefore, Jeremy refuses to give in by continuing with his development.
,And, Charles breaks through in the center.
,As does Jeremy.
,And, Charles is now threatening white's b2 pawn, as well as, the Rook.
,And, Jeremy puts a stop to that.  Even though it's not a London System, what I studied there from Susan Polgar is very applicable here because with the move played, it would now be a mistake for Charles to take on b2.  As now, Jeremy would have 7.Na4, and this would be followed by 8.Ra1 leaving the Queen virtually trapped.  That is a very well known fact.  Therefore, with that danger, Charles decides to exchange Knights.
,And, Charles responds with this pawn chain which is important with this position since they are right in the center.
,Meanwhile, Jeremy attacks the Queen, nonetheless.
,So, Charles counterattacks.
,But, then comes this nasty check since it is on the same file as Jeremy's Rb1.
,So, Charles blocks it temporarily by interposing with his Knight.
,And, Jeremy threatens to exchange.  In my opinion, it would be the right choice to accept it here because of what follows later.
,But, Charles has other ideas since he took the pawn, instead.  It appeared to be a free pawn.  However, I believe that this is the losing move because of what's to follow.  And, I only say that because of the misfortune with Jack Stockel in my first game with Tom Walsh on Friday, during the tournament.  So, it was the game before my very last annotation, in which Jack Stockel yelled at Tom and I which had negative affects on our play during the second game.  The mistake that should've lost was taking a pawn.  Sure, I was up a Queen for a minor piece or two.  But, then I took the doubled.  The problem was my N being pinned against my Queen with two of his Rooks.  I was very lucky that Tom overlooked it, but had he doubled up on one file, I would've lost the N, and would have to hand back my Queen to avoid mate.  From then on, I would be in a lost position.  Well I believe that more or less could be said here since these two pawns are weak.  And, is combined Jeremy's Ne5 and Bb5 becoming the killers for this game.
,And, Jeremy does what you typically see with a more experienced player.  And, it is something that was noted in the KOH forum which I posted, even dating back to when I was a beginner.  It's called refusing to castle.  As on the higher levels, there are times when not castling can win.  With what else unfolds, it is safe to say that it is the case here.
,Not liking what Jeremy played, Charles responds by taking another pawn.
,However, Jeremy responds by attacking the Queen.

"Black moves his LB to b7 and I would say that his bishops are on good squares but at present the knight is blocking the LB.  Black's knight will find it hard to get out since he does not have any useful squares to  occupy.
,I now move pawn to g3 in order to block black's access to h4 by his DB.
,Black moves his rook to b8.
,I moved my king to h1 as if black did attack via h4 square then my king may be at risk of check down the g file.
,Black moves his rook again, this time to c8, I am confused as I would have thought that may have been the best move anyway so why did black move his rook to b8!  Black can now move his queen away and the pawn at c7 is protected.
,Whilst black was making strange moves I continue to place my pieces with a view to finalising my attack.  I move my knight to g5 protected by the DB at f4.
,As expected black captures my knight but I do not recapture with the DB.  At present I also have my LB at d3 which is attacking the pawn at h7.  My queen is at e2 and looking at the h5 square.
,I now move my queen to h5 and I am attacking the h7 square.  Black has his pieces on the queen side and unable to gain access with his other pieces as I have the centre blocked.
,Black captures my DB at f4 with his DB at g5 but I could recapture with my pawn at g3.  I think the best move here might have been to move his pawn to h6 and prevent white's queen and LB working together.
,Now white captures the pawn at h7 with his LB and black's king cannot recapture as the queen is at h5.
,Black's king is forced to move to h8 as this is the only square available.
,White now captures black's DB at f4 with the pawn at g3.
,Black moves his knight to e7 possibly thinking on his next move he may go to g8 I am not sure.  A better move might have been pawn to g6 attacking the queen.
,White moves his rook to g1 in case black should move his knight to g6 then this could be captured.  
,So black's knight goes to f5 but I don't think this will be able to stop white's attack.
,White captures the knight on f5 with the LB at h7 and now the king is in check by the queen at h5.  The LB cannot be recaptured as the king needs to move out of check.  But once the king moves it will be all over.
,Black's king moves over to g8 his only square and white finishes the job with checkmate on h7.

"this was the 26th game of the match, and Euwe was leading one point ahead; if he would win this game in this 30-game match, he would be almost sure of winning the match...
,a gross oversight by Alekhine: trying to pull off the Dutch Defense against the Dutch champion... best now, is Bxd2+, Qxd2, Nf6, Bg2, 0-0, Nf3, d6, 0-0, Qe8, and just sit and wait...
,slightly sharper would have been 9. Nxe4 fxe4, 10. Ne5, but both giants are taking this easy... (note: whites' KN just went on a formidable journey across the board; move count = 2)
,Alekhine does not seem to feel very comfortable in this modern style type of opening play; he is fishing in murky waters, and already behind in development...
,slowly but surely, Alekhine is getting a firm grip on this game; White has no advantages left, and the next move might grant a slight edge for Black... (note: count = 6)
,after Bxf6, Nxf6, h3, Nh5, Black is firmly back in the saddle; but he hasn't counted on Euwe's reply...
,the smoke is clearing; White took 3 pawns for the black squared bishop, and gained a slight edge after Bd4, Ng5, Qd6, e4, Qg6... (note: count = 9)
,tries to tempt White into trading his strong Knight; not today...
,clearly underestimating the gravity of his situation; best is a6, e4, Bd4...
,countering Qd6 followed by Qg6; all of a sudden, Black is confronted with three connected free pawns, with his Bishop shut in; other than that is Rae1 becoming a potent threat...
,obviously trying to avoid the capture of e5, with two pawns against a piece; a bit tougher was Qh3, b5, Rae1, or straightaway Rae1...
,preparing Qg6, at the cost of Nd7...
,but White does not take the bait, covering for g1 in the process...
,Alekhines first real mistake; after Qf5, exd7, Rxg1+, Kxg1, Qxf4 or Qxd7, Black can keep up with the loss of material... now - once again, the cavalry rolls in...
,we wouldn't like Nf7+ at all... (note: count = 12)
,maybe Qxf4 works better...
,Euwe is missing an opportunity with Ne6, Re8, Qc3, or directly Qc3, to get rid of the Queens; but he goes about it differently...
,after Qxb2, d6, Rd7, Nc7, Rad8, Black is better prepared for what is coming; or maybe directly Rae8, followed by Rxe6...
,a bit soon: White had still time for b3, a3, b4 and such...

"As Tom interposed with his Q, instead.  That changes everything.  In part, I did not study this possibility.  Being very upset and for good reason, Jack said that I have now allowed Tom to equalize.  In fact, he said that with best play from both sides, Tom has a forced draw.  And, he might even be winning, whereas before, I was clearly winning.  Well, I don't think that white is lost, but I agree that best play will allow him to pull a swindle with a draw.
,After looking at it a little bit, I felt that exchanging was a way to fix my mistake.  Tom was doing a lot with his Queen, and the B was attacked.  I asked myself what to do here.  Perhaps there was something that I missed here, but I felt that exchanging helped to alleviate the problem that I caused for myself even though it means that he undoubled my pawns.  By this, I mean that I feel a little more comfortable about my position.  But, don't be fooled as I am less then satisfied, after the miscalculation.
,So, I defended this way thinking that I might be a little better off then 27.Bf4 or 27.Bd4 where he can attack again and gain another tempo.  I'm also threatening to gain a pawn in a different way.  Of course, I'm aware that Tom can defend it.
,? But, Tom played this.  I'm not sure why, but I am back to being satisfied.  The reason being is that I missed the opportunity to win another before.  But, that is now back, and I take advantage of it by capturing.  Another reason for feeling almost happy is due to c7 being attacked.
,? I don't know why Tom played this, but I win back the very pawn that I overlooked.  Remembering the oversight that I made the last time, I took it.  And, I am now a happy camper again.
,As Jack acted upset by saying, ""So you let him win the pawn again.""
,?? After this move, Jack said to Tom, ""White now has a won game.""  Being just about out of time since it's about noon which is when I need to leave I said, I don't see how I can win.  He said, ""Take a moment and see if you can figure it out.""  Well, due to it being a minute afterward combined with me having to go to work, I panicked a little.  But, I found just in the nick of time as Jack was finishing another game or watching somelse finish it.  I usually don't panick and know what to do, on a regular day.  But, regular isn't the case when you have to pack up and get ready for work.  The winning move, however, is what I play next. 
,Jack said, ""That's right.""  And, Tom resigned here, as now, he is too far behind.  Even if he answers with 30...Rxd8, I am now ahead by the equivalent to an entire Rook without compensation.  Moreover, it's an endgame which leaves black with a hopeless position.

"During this tournament, two youngsters were drawing a lot of attention; of course the 24-year old Latvian Michail Tal, by then the strongest player of Russia and even daring the great Botvinnik, who - by the way - dethroned Alekhine; Alekhine died without ever having played again for his title. And then there was this 18-year old brat from America, Bobby Fischer, who already succesfully had beaten most of all (European) grandmasters of that time; like the late and great Paul Morphy did before him...
,At this time, Fischer had never won a game against Tal; he lost four games with only two draws to account for. So Tal was truly a nemesis to Fischer; this variation was meant to diffuse Tal, because earlier in his career Fischer succesfully used Nb5, d6, Bf4 at Buenos Aires 1960... the Taimanov variation - deployed by Morphy, even before is was invented - which is indeed much stronger...
,Qc7, as supposed to avoid a direct Bf4; Whites' next simple move however 'masks a cunningly new idea' (Botvinnik); nowadays a normal practice against the Sicilian; g3, Bg2, 0-0, f4... at that time however, this was a novelty; and Tal turns it into a trap...
,Tal clearly wasn't paying attention: needed was a6, Bg2, Nf6; Fischer did not hesitate to call this 'probably the losing move' in his annotations...
,not very pleasant...
,truly inspired, and way stronger than Bg5 or even Bg2; the logical reply e5, Bg5, a6, Bxf6 is failing at either axb5, Bg5 or exf6, Na3...
,so Tal chose the risky way, just like he was used to; Whites' next move however, comes as a surprise...
,suddenly White has the better of the game; preparing Qd4, while still guarding b5 and g4... best for Black is d6, Qd4, Nc6, Nxd6+, Bxd6, Qxd6, e5, or a6, Qd4, d6, Rd1, Nfd7 etc...
,making matters worse...
,there is no doubt, that Black is in big trouble here; Ng1, Ne4, Be7, Qd2, followed by Nd6+ and 0-0-0 is crushing...
,no choice left...
,too eager to win material; after exf6, axb5, Ne4!, Bf8, Qd4, g6, Bxb5, Whites' advantage is even more substantial...
,trying to confuse the issue at hand; best is of course Qc7 (again: Botvinnik) or maybe Qa7...
,another inspired move to cover for c2; Bh5 is met with d5 and probable (?) drawing chances, and Bxb5 costs a piece after Qa5+... all other moves give Black the chance to regroup...
,there is no direct cure for Bxb5, so Tal plunges into the deep...
,again, Fischer is too intent to win material; he misses out on Bh5!, d6 (d5?, Rxd5!), Rhe1, Qe7, Qh6, Kd7, Qxh7, with a quick win ahead...
,Qd8 is going nowhere fast, after Qh6, f5, Qh5+, Ke7, g4!...
,Qxe5+, Qxe5, fxe5, Rxg7, was still giving drawing chances; but Fischer goes straight for the win, saccing his Queen along the way...
,the only one: after Qb6, Rhf1, all is over...
,relentless...

"The Dutch! I farely face it, and it is always a great think. 
,I go on with the London, that ""works with everything"". Well... :-)
,Not very aggressive, but I didnt' wanto to compromise myself until black shows something more, like...
,This. Thematic, grabbing the diagonal while I can't go for d4 or e5. Will I let him? Of course not!
,Saccing the central pawn for activity. 
,Still threatening the pawn, and inviting d5. That would close the center for now, and will let me organize the game. 
,More flexible, threatening the other pawn. If I play NxN+, QxN and I have nothing with Qh5+.
,ok, now Be3, NxB, QxN... playable, but disappointing. 
,I trust on a queenside castling, and ok, take my good B, but open my column and see what happens. 
,Here, I completely overlooked the threat on f5... :-(
,Inviting him into Qxh2. I'm not sure I can trap his Q, but he wouldn't dare. About around here, I noticed I had 30 seconds left for the rest of the game, +5 increment per move. 
,Silly move, but allows my Q to move, and he has to be very careful about his Q. This is a complex position, and it is very hard to calculate all the tactics. What if now black plays h6? Rg3.
,...with no faith at all, but my only resource is to press him and catch him by time. 
,I played the only OTHER move than Rg3 I can see to save material: Ng3. Now I see that it was the bad choice: after Rg3, Q must move (Qg6, say), then Nxe6, threatening again the Q, etc. But I was focused on h4 and h5.
,The manouver went ok, but the target (to fork the black R on f7) was not reached. Nothing better than retire, sigh!!!
,Even if I open the white diagonal, I have to go on attacking. I have only 10 secs max per move, about 20 sec on the clock. 
,The logic take was with the Q, but there is no real danger for black, after Rh7.
,I want to close his wing in, support my N's escape on f6, and force him to play d6, so e6 will be vulnerable to my lsb. 
,If Bg7, Rd4+, and d6 falls.

"So, I attack the B.  Therefore, Jack told Carl that he doesn't have to win the pawn right away.  Instead, it can wait since the idea is not letting me get the Bishop.  As the idea behind it is not allowing white to get anything else.  That's because even though the position appears even material wise, black certainly has an advantage.  I am hoping that there is a miscalculation which will turn it the other way or end the game in a draw.  But, that isn't so since black is keeping the advantage.  The reason for his advantage is because his g and h pawns are dangerous.  In fact, those are the killers.  With two isolated pawns against his connected pawns, black has the better end of it.  Now, had I stuck to this game and not let the anger get to me, those exchanges would've been refused.  And, I believe that it would've been level.
,With that being said, they decided to place this check on me.  The idea is that he's going to get win a pawn without anything in return.
,Once again, I try to stop that by attacking his Bishop.
,But, it's of no use.  
,Therefore, it was a choice between my h2 and c5 pawn.  But, I let Carl take on h2 since my passed pawn is on the c square.  Now, it's similar to Hope Chess as I'm hoping that black makes a mistake and allows me to promote my c pawn.
,So, I attack his Bishop.  And, I'm faced with the upcoming checks which is of no concern to me.
,And, that is by keeping my c pawn protected given that Carl's Ba6 is still attacked.  After defending it, I come up with a different hope which is not Hope Chess yet.  But, it will become that towards the end, as we'll see.
,After seeing what has happened to me in a couple of games, combined with what Susan Polgar showed in a stalemate lecture that would end the game in draw by repetition instead, I attempted the same idea.  That's right, I'm trying to trick to black into a draw by repetition.  And, that's by checking on the seventh and eighth rank.  Jack even asked me what I'm trying to do, and I told him that I thought that this might be a draw.  So, I persist on these checks.
,But, Jack has had enough, and he told Carl that he's not ready to let white off with a draw yet.  I thought that it was forced but overlooked that the K could go on the sixth rank.  Besides which, it wasn't a draw because black's position didn't repeat themselves 3 times the way that white's position did.  But, that was my attempt which didn't work, and having enough checks he decided to play this.
,However, I missed the that would've resulted in a swindle.  It was due to Tunnel Vision because I thought that my N was on a different line from black's King.  Therefore, I thought that if Rf7+, he could take the Rook but forgot that it was protected by the N. Therefore, best was 47.Rf7+.  And, now it goes from a disadvantage to win for white.  It was due to a similar fork that GM Susan Polgar showed in her book of Chess Tactics for Champions.  As that Bishop would've been free.  In doing so, I would've been able to move my Kc6 and promote the passed pawn.  And, Carl wouldn't have been able to stop it in anyway.  With this move, white is lost because black will stop it with his Bishop.
,Still attempting to promote, I free the c5 pawn.  As noted, had I check with the Rook and then captured the B, I would've been successful.
,As now, this check also favors black.
,So, I blocked it here.  But, Jack accurately said to Carl that my pawn is now pinned, and thus, of no use.
,?? With that, I attack his B.  But, this shortens the game even more because it will allow Carl to win a pawn and Rook for a Bishop.  Now, it is lost.
,So, it officially becomes Hope Chess.  Up until recently, I'd resign at this point.  But, I decide to let Carl promote and see where it goes from there because of what I remember from GM Susan Polgar.  The reason why it's Hope Chess is that mate will be inevitable, unless Carl messes up.  But, if he does that, I could still pull a swindle and get a stalemate.  I've seen examples from Susan where one side is even further ahead then black will be, even after he promotes.  But, Jack said that I have no hopes and implied that there will be no mistakes.  I don't completely trust him since he some time ago made a mistake that allowed me to checkmate in a hopelessly lost position.
,With what I mentioned, I was still hopeful here.
,But, that came to an end here.  In fact, Jack asked me how I was going to avoid checkmate here.  The answer is that it's unavoidable here.  That's because my monarch is stuck in the corner.  So, after 58.Kh7, Carl can just leave the Queen there and play 58...Ra7.  After that, my N is pinned, and thus, forces 59.Kh8.  From there, he'll checkmate with 59...Qxg7#  Seeing all of that, I resigned here.  I think the important lesson is that even if something happens that makes you angry, you shouldn't let get it you in a game.  Since that will affect one's judgement as it will happen to me.  For example, that's the main reason why I went back to exchanging just because it was possible to do so.  As otherwise, I would've been more patient and held off.  But, the other lesson is that opportunities only last a shortwhile.  And, had I play 47.Nf7+, I would've been back in the game with an advantage.  But, by missing that followed by another inaccuracy, it was over for white.  Well, after this game, Carl and I played one more which remains unfinished as we ran out of time.  But, Jack still took the time to coach like he did with these two games.

"As it is, my pawns are rather stopped in their tracks.
,I get behind the c-pawn, since the b-pawn clearly isn't going anywhere.
,White can now get his other Rook in front of the b-pawn.
,Time for my King to get involved.
,White has the same idea. With his extra piece for the pawns, though, I'd have thought building up an attack on the b-pawn a better plan?
,My King is trying to penetrate via d4.
,A plan soon stopped by the White King. But still, why not 36.Rb2, a better plan. White can get back into this if he plays it right.
,Since my c-pawn is safe I decide to cut off the White King's path.
,White drives my King back, but again 37.Rb2 is stronger.
,Curiously offering an exchange. With two passed pawns I fancy my chances.
,It allows White to get his Knight back into the game. My advantage is really only in my head now, but White's chances to seize the initiative have also gone.
,At least until I play this clanger, separating my connected pawns.
,The wrong place - 40.Nf3 and then 41.Nd4+ drives my Kings back and allows the White King to get to my c-pawn as well as winning the b-pawn:40. Nf3 Rc8 41. Nd4+ Kf7 42. Kd3 h5 43. Rxb5 Kg6 44. e5
,Time to launch my other passed pawn!
,The b-pawn and so the c-pawn must surely fall soon?
,I switch tack and keep my King on the K-side.
,While the White King heads over to stop my Q-side pawns. I've rather made a mess of this ending.
,At least I've got two passed pawns on the K-side to play with instead. Hopefully I make a better job of advancing them!
,But White dithers. Instead of mopping up the Q-side pawns (4. Rxb5 Rxb5 45. Nxb5 h4 46. Nxc3 h3)? he heads back.

,this leads straight to mate... tougher would have been Kh7, Ne4, Rh6, and try and haul in the other rook...
,Kh6 means sudden death after Rh8 and mate... Kxf6, Ne4+/Ncd7+, Kg7, Re7+, leads to similar variations...

,I interlock the f file and force his another rook to move a rather close g file

,Perhaps a rather pointless chasing of the Queen, which now has escape via c1 anyway. The Black Rook can't leave the defence of the d-pawn, so maybe keeping my own Rook on the g-file was a better idea.

"I start off with my usual.
,And, he answers with the Sicilian Defense.
,But, this, however, is another example of how intense openings can be.  As, for me, we're in unfamiliar territory.  The only moves that I'm familiar with are 2...d6 or 2...Nf6.
,So, I am trying to meet that change which is what you're supposed to do.
,My guess is that Charles is still trying to mix things up.  And, were it not for his c5, I'd play 4.d4, but I don't want to exchange, yet.
,So, I castle instead because I like getting my K in a safe spot.
,With a self imposed pin that he'll do, if I answer with Ne5 which will happen later on, Charles will now have a good defender against two attackers.
,Wanting to develop my Bc1 and enjoying the pawn chain that I've now got, this move was played.  What also came into consideration was 5.Nb1, but I felt that I'd hold off and play this first because I feel more comfortable.  And, my idea is trying to be comfortable as this is what will prevent from becoming impulsive enough to rush.  Or, just deciding on only one move like exchanging, and that's combined with judgement and mobility which all blends into what I learned from Kenneth_fiore_3.  The idea is to stay calm in order to play good chess.
,I was a little surprised to see Charles play this since it is more often played in the Ruy Lopez.  But, I guess that with any openings, the opponent doesn't enjoy the pinned N.  Of course, I am not going to exchange yet because I might need that B later on.  Instead, I'm treating like the Spanish Opening, in which case, after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6, it is better to not exchange right away with 4.Bxc6  I found the logic behind this with GM Susan Polgar.  The logic is that right in the opening like that, B's are generally favored over N's, and exchanging that B that early will often lead you with a disadvantage. 
,After which, this move is also followed.
,The idea is exchanging pawn. 
,Figuring that there was no way to avoid it, I exchanged.  But, I didn't evaluate this carefully.  I looked at 8.e5, and felt that I'd lose a pawn with 8...Nxe5.  What I forgot, however, is that my e5 pawn would've been protected by my Nf3.
,?? This was played to continue developing as I intend to develop my Nb1.  The real question is when.  However, this is a blunder that is similar to the Noah's Ark Trap.  Just like what happened in a consultation game between brigadecommander and stalhandske, I overlooked that my B will be trapped here with the next move.  In the process, I'm going to lose a piece for a pawn.  With best play, which I expect from black, Charles will win the game.  I am, however, not resigning yet, as I feel that there is more to learn.  That is especially with the Queens off the board.
,As now, black's Ne7 is pinned.  And, the reason why that could be of significance is because of what Jack Stockel emphasized in my loss against Loyd during an OTB tourney.  That is, what good is to have extra points, like a piece if you can't use it.  In my case, it was one piece remaining undeveloped, with which, Loyd was going to win it back.  So, I kept that in mind with this pin.
,Seeing the same thing, though, Charles break the pin by attacking my N.
,So, I try to do something different leaving a half pin.  Though ineffective, just like what I learned with Yoga, everyday is a different journey.  And, it's about where that journey is.  So, we accept things for the way they are.  Just like in Yoga when you have a hard time, and sometimes, can't fulfill the balance.  You don't fight, but rather, accept it.  Well, that's also the way that chess work which is also why I compare chess to Yoga classes since, overtime, they have helped me to become a better player.
,I think that Charles is trying to get a passed pawn, somehow.
,In case he plans to do something with his a or c pawns, I block c4 and try to stop him from playing 15...a4  However, I forgot that he could still do that due blacks Ra8.
,Threatening to exchange and mess up my K side pawn structures which is very important.
,So, I put a stop to that, by attacking Charles c4 pawn.

"vermijdt 3... Bb4, maar laat zwart toe wit in ontwikkeling bij te benen. Immers, zwart heeft goede alternatieven naast Bb4

,Als dit geen pion kostte voor wit zou het een goede zet zijn. Maar ik had een paar zetten eerder gezien dat de zet niet werkte; anders had ik misschien niet met het paard op f6 teruggeslagen.
Alternative variation: 10.Nf3 Ne4 [dit zou het spel vereenvoudigen, waarna zwart hoegenaamd geen problemen meer zou hebben. Om die reden speelde mijn tegenstander zonder veel na te denken eerst Bd3 op de tiende zet, over het hoofd ziend dat dit een pion kost.] 

,Zwarts dame staat hier natuurlijk wat gevaarlijk, terwijl al wits stukken zich kunnen ontwikkelen naar goede, actieve velden. Daarom dat wit ook optimistisch was over zijn stelling. Hij dacht dat ik me niet van het gevaar bewust was. 

,Alternative variation: 13...Ng4? [verleidelijk] 14.Re2 +--          ( 14.Bxe7 Qxf2+ 15.Kh1 Ne3 16.Qe2 Qxe2 17.Rxe2 Re8 +- )     

,Alternative variation: 14.Ne5 [was beter] 

,goed genoeg, maar waarschijnlijk niet de beste voortzetting
Alternative variation: 18...Bd6 [misschien beter] 
Alternative variation: 18...Ng4 [misschien ook beter, maar om zijn complexiteit wel minder pragmatisch] 

,Alternative variation: 19...Qb6! [wint een tempo!] 20.Rb1 Qd6 
Alternative variation: 19...Bxb3 20.Qxb3 Qd2?! [lang overwogen] 21.Rd1          ( 21.Re3 [leek me minder veelbelovend dan de alternatieven, en daarom heb ik 19... Bxb3 uiteindelijk (gelukkig) niet gespeeld] )     21...Rxd3?? [dit heb ik ook overwogen, zonder de weerlegging te zien] 22.Qxd3 = 

,Alternative variation: 20...Ng4! 21.Bxe7 Qxe7 22.Ree1?! Bxb3 23.Qxb3 Qd6 
Alternative variation: 20...Bxb3 21.Qxb3 Ng4 

,deze verdediging had ik moeten overwegen

,het foute plan, maar ik heb nog steeds een winnende stelling
Alternative variation: 21...Qc7 [hier heb ik uiteindelijk niet voor gekozen, maar het was wel een betere zet] 

,Hier heb ik lang getwijfeld tussen 25... Qg4 en het dameoffer 25... Rd7, wat ik uiteindelijk gespeeld heb. Volgens de computer is Qg4 een relatief goede zet, maar niet de beste. De beste zet is effectief de dame te offeren, maar niet met Rd7. Rd7 is onnauwkeurig. Nauwkeuriger is Bd6.

,Alternative variation: 25...Bd6 [De keuze van de computer en de juiste manier om het dameofferplan uit te voeren.] 26.Bh7+ Nxh7 27.Rxd4 cxd4 28.Re1 Bxg3 29.Qxg3 Rac8 --+ 
Alternative variation: 25...Qg4 26.Ree1 b6 

,Alternative variation: 26.Be2! += [wit kan hier de loper naar een veel beter veld dan h7 spelen, ook de zwarte dame winnend, maar tegen een veel lagere prijs. Gelukkig heeft mijn tegenstander dat niet gezien.] 
Alternative variation: 26.Bc2 [was ook goed voor wit] 
Alternative variation: 26.Ree1 [zelfs dit was goed voor wit] 

,hier heb ik heel lang nagedacht, maar uiteindelijk heb ik niet de beste beslissing genomen. Mijn gevoel waarschuwde me ook dat het niet de beste zet was. Aan de andere kant is het zeker ook geen slechte zet en was het een betere zet dan Nf8, de andere optie die ik overwoog.

,Alternative variation: 29.Bh4 f6! 

,deze follow-up, correct als antwoord op 29. Bh4 is hier echter niet de beste zet

,Alternative variation: 30.Re1! Nf7 31.Rxe6 =+ [simpel maar dodelijk. Van mijn voordeel schiet nog maar een klein restje over] 

,de reden waarom dit twijfelachtig is, is een computerlijn (zie de variatie op de 32ste zet); ik denk niet dat een mens die snel gevonden zou hebben. Voor een mens is het een okÈ zet.

,Alternative variation: 32.hxg5! Bxb6 33.gxf6 gxf6? 34.Qg6+ Rg7 35.Qxf6 

,Alternative variation: 33...Rad8! [dit durfde ik niet aan] 34.Rxb7          ( 34.Qxe6 d3 [Het is de speelbaarheid van deze lijn die ik niet onderkend had] )     34...Rxb7 35.Qxb7 d3 36.Be1 [Tot hier had ik nochtans gezien en ik had hier geen schrik van]

"But, that does not bother me.  In fact, I give him back the pawn because my focus is on the passed pawn.  Once again, the idea is mobility since my plan is to promote here.
,Of course, I know what Jack is about to do.  However, I have no problem with him getting another pawn.  As I will continue to push my passed pawn.  And, on top of it, I'll use my K along with it.  Thinking like this is how I won against ftvmini.  And, at the time, his rating was about 500 points north of my rating which made for an interesting game, especially since I was down a piece early.  I am keeping all of that in mind here.
,As this will, again, allow my K to move up, along with, my pawn.  But, this, however, is where I'm starting to go wrong because of where Jack's R is placed.
,Jack's original play was 50...Rh3+  But, he deemed that as a blunder since that would allow what I play next.  And, as you'll see, it should wait a move.
,As now, Jack can and will do something with my passed pawn.  So, best was 51.c6.  It also comes to show where move order is important since that's what I play next.  However, this give Jack to stop that pawn and pull a swindle.  Had I just advanced the pawn right away, I would've been able to promote, as I would get the pawn to 8th rank before Jack would have the chance to get his R to the 8th rank.
,His original play was play 51...e4? with the idea of promoting.  But, Jack said that it was unplayable because of my original response being 52.Kd4 which wins that pawn and the game.
,So, I respond by pushing that pawn.  Even though I got the move order wrong, it is not too late to promote that pawn. 
,?! My idea was liquidating since I am ahead.  However, better would've been 53.c7  Even stronger was 53.Kc5 which guarantees the promotion.  As afterwards, there's so much I can do with it, whilst supporting that pawn.  And, black would be helpless against that.  The bad part is that it didn't come into consideration.  But, K against the pawn like that is a known win.  With that being said, this is the move that throws away the win.  The important thing to remember is what role the K plays in the endgame.  I know but underestimate the amount of power the monarch contains at that phase.  
,Trying to stop that pawn.
,So, I push again.  Of course, I overlooked his next move.  But, it is worth it for a promotion.
,? But, this is the move that throws away the win.  What I didn't consider was 55.Na6  And, that would've forced Jack to give up his R for a pawn to prevent the promotion.  But, black is busted after that move.  By playing this, he can and will keep that pawn block.  The win isn't over yet, but the chances are very slim as I have lost all of my advantage with this move.
,Pushing his pawn and trying to promote.
,So, I put a stop to that.  And, it appears that Jack has lost a R for a pawn, but this is a draw.  Surely, a N+R+K is a win against just the K.  But, it's very difficult to win, though.  In contrast, those extra pawns make that win impossible.
,As now, Jack is trying to promote one of the pawns.
,And, I try to stop that by taking here.  When Jack advances again...
,I get my R involved to stop that pawn from promoting.
,Doing what he can do, Jack supports that pawn.
,So, I try to intimidate my coach by making him think that the pawn is in danger.
,And, it works.  The plan behind is to go after his f6 pawn which starts with my next move.
,But, I was thinking about Ke4-f5 which is why I played this, as opposed to, 61.Kd5  The other idea was to do something, in case, Jack is to promote.

"...neglecting the stronger Bb5+, as most low-rated games. I can play against it, but it is certainly more delicate for black. 
,Bg4 gives black a Portuguese Attack with a tempo less, so it can't be good. Now my plan is to castle queenside and throw pawns on white's castled king. White can win this race, but he has to be very precise. Let's see if my opp is.
,The right move. Now white threatens Re1 and Ng5. 
,Better is to castle and to prevent Bf4.
,Some players prefer c4. This is a tempo for me to consolidate my position. 
,If Re1, o-o-o. Then, white can get ideas of RxB, and it is another game. 
,Threatens d5, x-raying a7.
,I don't care. I have to attack asap.
,White will eventually break into my Qside, so I have to keep chances on his Kside.
,I should have left it where it is, that's all! Now I have another tempo to build my attack: g4, Be7...
,I wanted to trap it, but it was the beginning of a more complicated motif. 
,Qa6+ is threatened. 
,Here I didn't see Bxc4... but I'm not sure I would have played it, (after Re3). It's a nice position: the N5 can discover an attack on the WQ, but if he does, it allows Qa6+. Something has to protect a6. But I was focused on the threat on Rh8 after Qb2.  
,Threatens my R... 
,If NxR, NxN, Q moves and I win back the exchange with N+Re1. 
,QxB, Qa1+ will allow his Q to fly and to take Rd3.
,Qa4 may have been better. Now I have...
,Still, I'm not getting anywhere! QxB, NxR...
,Not a wonderful outcome! It could be worse. 
,? Well, this allows Qxc6+, QxQ, NxQ, Rxa2. Not so bad...

"I start off with my usual.
,And, Jack wanted to change things up by playing the Siclian.  However, I'm all too familiar with it.  So, we stay in familiar until...
,This move.  As normally, 4...Nf6 is played, in which, white defends with 5.Nc3.  After that, it generally continues with 5...a6  But, with this move, I go back to the original square, as I don't know if other moves are better or not.
,That doesn't mean too much, though, as I looked at moves like 5.Nb5 and 5.Nb3  But, as usual, I didn't spend more then a few seconds considering them because I really didn't know what made them better or not.  Therefore, I just didn't see the point as one move with the N doesn't seem better or worse then the other.  So, I figure that it made the most sense to get the N back to it's original square and work my way from there.
,Not to my surprise, Jack continues with his development.
,As do I by pinning his Nf6.
,Not surprisingly, this is how he breaks the pin as it is the most common way to do it.  Believe it or not, this is what I also would've played but not because it's the most common.  The real reason is that it brings black one step closer to castling.  And, I say that because I also would've given 6...h6 some consideration.  But, I don't like what happens after black castles which is why it would've ruled out of court, as that way, none of the pawns near the castled King have moved.
,Meanwhile, nothing holds me back from continuing with my development.  I did consider bringing my Bf1 into play at once with something like 7.Bc4 or 7.Bb5+.  But, I'm more comfortable getting the N out first, anyhow.
,I guess Jack has the same idea in mind.  But, this is also why I was not ready to play 7.Bb5+ at once.  As now, I can and will pin the N.
,I anticipated him breaking the pin with 8...Bd7.  With this played, I considered exchanging 8...Bxc6  But, not getting doubled pawns in return and, thus, keeping two connected pawns, I didn't see the point.  That's because after my first lesson with Ken, I thought about the possibility of using my Bb5 later on.  So, I decided to castle instead, just like Jack.
,What I overlooked is this pin, as now, Jack will force a different exchange.  Better might have been 9...Nd2.  However, after a little consideration, I decided that exchanging is doesn't benefit black.  And, to my knowing, I might get an edge as his Bg4 appears stronger then my Nf3.  Therefore, I felt that a good strategy, in this position, is to connect my Rooks at once by moving the Queen to same rank as my Knights since, as usual, I have no idea of what else to do.  Obviously, I'm not going to exchange on c6.
,As the saying goes, ""Don't trust your opponent"".  His instincts are right because another plan behind 10.Qd3 is that with Queen and Bishop on the same line, white, I believe, would get a stronger position.  So, Jack does what he can to stop it.
,But, I make it uneasy by bringing the Queen back to where it was.  Which means that the pressure is back on his next move.
,So, I play this, as opposed to 13.Ba4, and it's still under the technicality that pressure against that f7 pawn worked in one game.  Plus, I was also a little worried that if I went back to a4, he could move the Queen which would threaten to trap my Bishop, with a later ...b5 which is somewhat similar to what we see in the Noah's Ark Trap.  So, I felt that to avoid any complications, combined with what happened in one game, this was best.  Now, if things, get out of control, I can always move my Queen, followed by the Bishop back and out of harms way, if the situation is to arise.
,Of course, Jack will have none of that, as he threatens to exchange.
,And, I refuse by attacking his Queen.
,?! Instead of retreating, I felt that I was ok by adding an extra defender to Bc4.  But, I was wrong as this not only blocks the Bishop but will allow Jack to exchange, at the very least.  Better was to retreat with 15.Bd5, and that way, if 15...Nxd5, instead of recapturing the N, I'd take on e7.  And, after those series of exchanges, I'd feel more comfortable with my position.  By playing this move, he'll prevent what I noted with his next move, but that's not all.
,? As here, I get too greedy and try to fork his Na5 and Qc7.  It's called being too happy about my position which as Ken noted in a recent annotation, I did the same thing against Tom Walsh which is another reason that I lost.  But, this is going to lose a pawn after Jack exchanges.  Better was 16.Bd5, and if Jack exchanges, it's not so bad.  As it would remain even, as opposed to losing a pawn and winding up with doubled pawns.
,Trying to halt off the attack, I don't hesitate to attack his Rook.  And, by not hesitating, it means that I was not going to consider anything else.  That's because of what ION said when you're at a disadvantage which is, ""Play the man, not the board.""
,Of course, Jack is not going to allow it.

"And, the reason being is that this allowed me to reconnect my pawns.  With that being said, I go now from comfortable to feeling very happy about my position and actually should be.  The reason being is that only one desicive mistake was made but not here.  And, with best play, in this position, the game should end in a draw, as Jack pointed out.  Believe it or not, that's how I'm thinking now as I am confident about the possibility about getting a draw.  In other words, that is my thought process starting now, and because of what Mr. Stockel said later on, I am correct here.  Of course, I know not to trust to your opponent, but it's a question of when he's right or not.  With this game, due to my thought process, I reckon that he's right.  In fact, my belief is that he is spot on.
,But, here comes a dangerous plan which I'm bound to overlook.  The plan is to double.  But, as usual, two rooks on one file can be very dangerous, as it will be here.
,I threaten a mate which I know that won't miss.  But, I'm thinking about something that Ken has taught me.  So, the question is, what happens after 21.Qd3
,The answer is this move, as I plan to check on b2.
,And, this was the conditional move because, as noted, he has doubled up.  Therefore, it allows me to check.  I'm not doing for the thrills and giggles on this move.  But, rather, I want to see if the glaucoma will play a role.  For if it does, and he doesn't interpose, I can win his g2 pawn.  However, Jack sees right through that and sure enough interposes.
,Therefore, I check in hopes that he'll block with his c4 pawn.  Once again, that hope is based on the glaucoma as then, I'd pick up a pawn that way.  But, as anticipated, Jack doesn't give it up.
,?? Just like with what Jack has done, my goal was to double up in such a way that one of my Rooks is not cramped.  So, it's also about a good outpost, but this was the decisive mistake as Jack pointed.  As now, not only will he win a pawn, but this will give him a mating net that I overlooked.  After the game, we went over variations.  He said that my only options were 24...Re7, 24...Qd7.  Of those two, I like 24...Re7 the best because it allows me to double up with a later ...Re8.  Perhaps, even on the next move.  The point is that one of the major pieces had to be on the 7th rank to keep my P and K protected.  By playing this it's over.  So, after the game was over, we played through some variations right after 24.Kf2.  It involved black playing 24...Re7.  Yes, there was one mistake much later that lost with his passed pawn.  But, this is where my instincts (thought process) was verified.  For after, 24.Kf2, Re7, or 24...Qd7 if black plays everything accurately, it's, at the very least, a draw.  And, if white makes one error, black would, in fact, be able to win.  Of course, Jack wouldn't have made it, but I did have the opportunity to draw the game up until now.  But, that also shows that unlike some previous games, I had a very good reason to be happy about my position.  But, this blunder, it's game over, at once starting with his next move.  
,Feeling like I've achieved my goal, I double up and threaten to take on e3.  However, it's irrelevant because of what's about to unfold.
,Thinking that it was safe, I played this to protect my Rook.  Jack: Aren't you missing something.  Joe: I don't think so.  But, then he showed me his next move which is, indeed, checkmate.  And, that's when we went reviewed why on my 24th move, it was necessary to keep my R or Q on the seventh.  As it is the same rank where he got my pawn, and later the King.  As it turns out, one them would've guarded against what unraveled.  And, that became one of the main teaching lessons since we spent about 30 minutes studying what happens after 24...Re7 before starting the next game which I also lost with a back rank mate.  That's when he later reemphasized how important King Safety is.  And, there was, I believe, a 15 minute lesson before we had to pack up and leave.

"This does continue with Dan's development.  However, just like a GM game that fiercequeen annotated, the N is, indeed, in the wrong place.  Thus, I would not have hesitated to play 15...Nd7.  What's worse is that even though, there is a little mobility with the R, whereas, we didn't see it before, it's still limited.  On the other hand, had Dan developed that N to d7, the R would be free to move about.  And, the reason I draw that conclusion is because of just how important mobility is.  In this context, I think it's even more important because of how compromised the other wing is.  In other words, the K side is blocked up, completely, so my thinking is why compromise the Q side, at all?  Methinks that this ensures white a win.  Although I did favor Joe's position, with this move played, I think that white now has a win.
,As now, Joe uses that time to harrass black's Q, for starters.
,Then, Joe completes his development.  And, it's worth noting that of his minor pieces are well places, whereas, one of black's pieces is gone.  Additionally, two of the others are not in a good spot.  So, that, immediately boils down to space advantage.  Now, fiercequeen said that it's not really about material advantage, but rather, it often comes down to space.  Well, I'd say that this is the case here. 
,Going after white's pawn.
,So, Joe protects it by going right after Dan's Queen.  But, there is a lot more to this then meets the eye.   I don't just think so anymore, but this is where I just begin to realize that white definitely has a won game here.  It's not official yet, though.  As it's not, ok white only has this and that to do to win.  But, with the best, which happens with Joe, white has a won game.  The reason being is that this N is now one of the main pieces that's indirectly attacking black's K, as we will see towards the end.
,As this was one of the plans behind attacking the Q.  The immediate effect, of course, is that Dan recaptures to avoid giving away a pawn, after having had handed back a minor piece.  However...
,!! By my books, this is a killer move right here.  Might not be worth two exclamation points, but I give it that because Joe adds another attacker to Dan's K.  So, things are unleashing here.  As now, this R will become very dangerous, as we're about to see.  It's still not quite easy, yet, but a win from white is closer.  In other words, it's a little bit quicker then what I thought earlier.  However, with best play from black, it still might take a while.  I was thinking before was that it might take over 20 moves, but I'm pretty confident that white can win, in about 10 moves.
,?? Trying to get a pawn, and maybe, thinking of a different mating attack similar to what I mentioned earlier, Dan played this.  Of course, even though I was beginning to realize that white has a won game, it wasn't official.  In other words, that would taken, at least, 10 moves.  But, with this move, however, a win is near.  Much better would've been 20...g6 to force the N back. 
,And, that's because of this move which is why I gave 20.Rh3 two exclamation points.  Black can hold the game a little longer with 21...g6, but after something like 22.Bh6 Bxh6 23.Nh6+, Dan is in a lot of trouble.  Or even something like 22.hxg6 Bxg6 23.Bh6, as now, black must do something to prevent a later Nh6+ where mate would not be far off.  So, after something like 23...Bd6 white can immediately play 24.Bg7+ which immediately wins back a R for B.  Or 24.Ng6+ which is a quicker and might be mate.  If not right away, it would be mate shortly after.  But, either way, black's position is hopeless.
,?? But, this game guarantees an instant checkmate.
,What Joe told me is the moral of this game.  In it, he said, ""adrenaline simply blocked his K in with Bishops and made the mistake of never developing either of his Rooks,especially the h8 Rook which played a part in his demise""  It's also worth noting that what got Dan's DSB blocked in was his failure to develop that.  It comes to show that even being a Q up, against stronger opposition, especially a senior, getting your minor pieces developed quickly is essential.

"This is my testing scheme against such white's asset. No theory behind, just the feeling (and some experience with the same asset with white pieces!)
,Not sure it is recommendable, but I tried it. I'm sure it's pretty covered by theory.
,Asking questions (ah, the club jergon!) to b2.
,One of the less recommendable answers, because it makes me easy to develop and reach equality. No real threa on the black diagonal (not while the c pawn is mobile), but I have space to manouver. Now, if I lose time by freeing my lsb, maybe - just maybe - I miss the chance to cause him some problems. 
,Of course, if Be3, d5 and this B has to move again to become useful. 
,? I'm still dreaming of an attack on the black diag, so I make this lsb going out of the d2 coverage. But it was just a bad idea, since white can easily answer c4 - I'm giving him the occasion by allowing my N to be threatened. True is that in order to play it he has to play a3 first, and I can try the Qa5 attack where if b4, Nxb4, etc, since a3 is pinned to the R. 
,I didn't dare to play the Qa4-b4-Nxb4-cxb4-Bxb4+, not while d2 is still all that covered. 
,...so this is my ""plan"": to attack on the kingside (the original purpose of black's asset), but with the disadvantage of having the Q almost useless on b6, and my own Qside far from being able to develop. On the other side, white has more or less the same problem: he has to castle just under my advancing pawns, and his minor pieces can be harassed - soon or later. If I play d6, Bd7, o-o-o... he will do whatever he wants (like c4. Fortunately for me, he assumes that Nb4 is still very powerful, but he can easily move his lsb from d3, or play a3 and make c4 a threat.)
,Now, it was my chance. Unfortunately, g4-Nh4 kind of blocks my attack, and h4 was not possible due to Nxg5 (h4 but the lsb can move. I can get rid of it, yes, but not much more (I could see!). But now it's my chance to play the ""wonderful""...
,Noah's Ark in sight. If h3, f4, I'm not scared by Bg6+, Kd8.
,I can exchange this B, sure, but I'll have in e5 a N, threatening to come to g6... I wasn't sure. These were time-consuming moments for both of us. 
,This pins my own f pawn, but I dont' have to move it necessarily. I'm doing this because I want to keep my R on th h column, in sight of a possible sacrifice (Nxg5). Moreover: I can play on this lsb by harassing it with d6, and It will be lost for white. In return, I'll have to waken my e6 pawn, which is very dangerous in this asset. The advantage of doing that: white, as far as I can see, is in no position to cause a serious threat on e6 in few moves. My lsb will become active without even having moved from his home square. My R is trapped, as his. A R on the 7ºth will always help my K...
,No risk, no win. I think I can hold e6. But I was wrong: now white has Bxf4, and if exB... Nxg5, hxN, Qxg4!?...
,The sac! More time-consuming decisions...
,No basis for the sac. He just helped me. I hope so, at least! True is that I will have to play carefully - not like my usual!
,You have to be careful with things like Be7??, Qg8+, winning the R. 
,Here, white realizes that he has 1) b2 threatened, 2) if dxe5, it just opens a future line for my lsb and give action to my Q. 3) Rxe5 was just losing the exchange... so he thought it was smart to play...
,...instead. He hopes in Bh5+, but I have a better move to play. 
,White is +4, but he is just too underdeveloped. His sacs were not well timed. The interesting part of this clumsy game is the center situation. Look at it... but now, black has serious threats, for example, Nxg2 (followed by Rg7)
,A desperado - and useless move. At this point, you may say black is just winning, and that the game is over. But another thing is to play it with less-than one minute on the clock (5 sec increment, but still...)

,Probing my king. I think he's looking for ways to come down
,Renews a pin with the threats of c4 
,At least the squares his queen has access too behind my pawn line are protected.
,He finally plays c4 but without a pin and a way for his queen to come in. My Knight becomes deadly!
,If opponent blocks with c3 I have to capture the pawn with queen. It forces a queen exchange but my Knight forks the two rooks

"?! finally putting a kibosh on Black ever castling and enabling me to recentralise my Q but after the game our Bd1 suggested that I should have preceded this move with 24. Re1!, followed by 25. Qf6 threatening mate.
,I started to feel a bit more comfortable now.
,We now commence a long period of manoeuvring to try to gain a decisive advantage by shifting threats to, and defences of, weak spots.  This move begins preparation for the advance of Black's a-pawn.
,Relived of its immediate defensive duty, the N advances to a better square.
,Renewing the threat to d5.
,I was somewhat concerned when making this move that I might need to return the N to c1 pronto when Black had finished his manoeuvring but I didn't want to tie it indefinitely to that duty and the immediate need was to renew defence of d5.  The other need was to ensure that after any clearance of material f3 was defended.  Further ahead, I was considering the possibility of f4 and Ne1-f3-g5.
,With no immediate threat from Black and no constructively defensive move available, I decided to begin to set up a threat to Black's King at last.
,Allowing Black's B to support the advance of the a-pawn and ensuring that I have to continue to be prepared to defend c2.
,Defending e7 and attacking e2.
,Allowing Black's Q to defend b4 when the a-pawn advances.
,I was a bit concerned now that my pieces could get trapped in the centre but this was necessary to allow my N to return to d3 while keeping d5 defended.
,Black unpins his e-pawn and possibly prepares to connect his Rooks.
,Unexpected ... Perhaps he thought that I was threatening to return to g7 to win a pawn or two.
,I wasn't confident that swapping Queens would help me as my pawn structure didn't look as strong as Black's.  The remaining moves consist of more attempts to pressurise my defence of my pawns while I endeavour not to blunder ...
,and, with less than 5 minutes on his clock, compared to my 16, Black offered the draw.  Even with my extra time, I didn't think I could force a win, so I quickly accepted.  We'd already lost the match anyway.

"Caro Kann: unpretentious and solid.  Beware.
,Challenging the centre.  You will note that the French Defence has an analogous opening sequence: 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5.
,A popular third move (as it is in the French, as well).  Almost equally popular are 3.e5 (the Advance Variation) and 3.exd5.  The latter has been something of a favourite of mine, leading to the Panov-Botvinnik Attack (3.exd5 cxd5 4.c4) with some similarities to a QP opening.
,'Surrendering the centre' the wiseacres used to sneer when they saw this move.  It does nothing of the kind, of course!
,A very popular development, forcing White to move the knight a third time.  White COULD defend the knight by 5.Bd3 or 5.Qf3, but there is no compelling need to do so...
,... as this retreat attacks the bishop in turn.  
,Normal, by a large margin.  The bishop standing on the h7-b1 diagonal leaves White wondering what to do with his own light-square bishop (LSB).  There is little attraction in defending the bishop where it stands.  But there is an interesting try in the strange-looking 5...Nf6?! 6.Nxf5 Qa5ch 7.c3 (or Bd2) Qxf5 - unclear but maybe White gets more out of this line than Black does.  For one thing White would still have his LSB.
,Marking the g6-bishop as a target.  White hopes that this apparently crude  thrust will lead later on to better things in the way of a K-side attack.  Things don't quite go that way.
,The usual response, though ...h5 has been tried.  Black wants to keep his bishop, even though it may be forced to make a third move.
,'In your face!'  Forced the bishop back to h7, but there the bishop is quite snug, its gaze firmly fixed down the h7-b1 diagonal.
,Forced, but Black won't be unhappy about that.
,A very difficult decision, in my view.  The Black LSB having moved three times already, is being invited to make a fourth move to exchange itself off for the White one, which has just made its first move.  In effect White is offering a trade, with (four minus one equals) three tempi to sugar-coat the deal for herself.  There isn't much Black can do about it, neither, but fall in with the trade.  It turns out, though, that the absence of White's LSB subsequently tends to deprive White of a valuable attacking resource.  Black therefore has something to throw onto the bottom line to offset the 'lost' three tempi.
,There really is no sensible alternative, here.  The bishop is going anyway - might as well get that over and done with.  There is nothing to be gained by 9...Ngf6 10.Bxh7 Nxh7 with even more loss of time for Black.
,Of course, nothing good can come of 10.cxd3(?), with doubled and isolated pawns stuck on a file half-open for Black's rooks.
,White has a very slight lead in development, but no real threats so far.  Black is solidly placed - no real weaknesses - but perhaps feeling just a little constrained by White's greater control of the central regions.
,A good square and diagonal (h2-b8) for the dark-square bishop (DSB).  Could this make Black think twice about castling Q-side? 
,At once drives the bishop off the sensitive diagonal.  Since the bishop was so easily thrown off f4, does that mean White was wrong to move it there?  By no means.  Black has been induced to place his knight on d5, where it will become a target for the White c-pawn.  So of course...
,...White keeps the bishop on the board.  The insignificant loss of time will be recovered.... eventually.
,Possibly a risky development in the light of the exposure of the other knight to attack.  More circumspect seems 12...e6.
,This seems logical enough: place the king onto safety, and bring a rook onto a central file, leaving the other - the e-file - for the other rook.  But I feel sure I would have played 13.c4, here, and after 13...Nb6, castled long with the prospect of opening up the d-file for the activated rook.  The move order can not be reversed...

"After I attacked his Nd2, Jack played this.  Had he retreated, I would remain that far down.  But, by playing this, it goes back to me being down the equivalent piece for pawn.  Of course, that doesn't say much because white is still in bad shape and with a disadvantage.  In fact, it is still, as noted, winning for black.  
,With my monarch confined to the first rank combined with Jack threatening mate, this was played bearing in mind that the Rook is protected by my Nd3.  The danger, of course, was 35...Rdc2.  From there, he was threatening ....Rcg2 which allows the back rank mate, so by playing this, I saw what was coming and put a stop to it.
,Therefore, Jack responds by placing me in check.
,And, I decide to interpose with my Nd3.  I also looked at getting out with the K, but then, Jack would be able to check on the second rank and liquidate my Rb2 which I didn't want to allow since I'm still behind.
,Therefore, Jack tries a new strategy by pushing his passer since, ""passed pawns must be pushed.""
,Since we're now approaching the endgame, I decide to use my K as a weapon.  It's not the best choice because of Jack's next move.
,I considered and almost played 37...Kd3??.  But, Jack rightfully showed that this is a blunder because of what I call this half skewer against my Rb2.  Therefore, I was about to, believe it or not, resign in this position.  But, Jack said what he always emphasizes which I told to my student, Erika.  It wasn't only not giving up so quickly, but he also said, ""Now, start thinking"".  And, with it, I found the only way to defend the position.  However, it's more then just the only way, as it is the turning point in the game.  Before I made that comment, so up until this point he had the advantage which is why I got ready to resign.  But, because I told him that I was ready to give up since there is appears to be nothing else to learn, he is going to let me win from here on in.  And, the purpose to teach me otherwise, as the idea is that there is more to learn.  In addition, Jack has, on occasion, let his students beat them for teaching purposes.
,Because of my last move, Jack intends to place pressure on my Ne1.
,So, I put a stop to that by remobilizing my Knight.
,And, Jack redeploys his Bishop.
,So, I repost my N.  The reason is that it threatens to fork his Rc7 and Be7/
,Of course, Jack puts a stop to that by attacking my Bf2 twice since it is only defended once.
,So, I defend it a second time to match the equation of how many times it got attacked.  As that is how you protect material.  Of course, Jack is going to liquidate, but is better then letting him have another free piece.  As then, I would not have found the opportunity to win which I didn't realize that he did intentionally until the game was over.  As losing another piece would surely mean game over for white. 
,With that, Jack pushes his passed pawn again.
,So, I attack his d6 pawn.
,Which Jack defends again.
,And, I move my King up.  As the idea is supporting my f pawn, as it's dangerous.  However, what I also keep in mind is the possibility of supporting my Rd5.
,Of course, Jack tries to put a stop to that, as the idea is to centralize the K which is very useful in the endgame.
,Therefore, I attack d6 a second time.
,And, Jack defends that pawn again by centralizing his monarch.

"[!]  Blunting the c2-c4 thrust as 14.c4 Nb4! is now possible, disrupting White.  
,White is fully mobilised (developed); Black very nearly so.  There doesn't seem to be much in it, eh?  But White does have a move that might have occasioned Black something of a headache...
,[?!] This isn't it, though it's an OK move.  Instead 15.Nf5!  attacking the g-pawn and threatening the bishop would have placed Black in some difficulty.  Could he contemplate undeveloping the bishop (...Bf8)?  The line is extremely complicated and hard to see: 15.Nf5! Nh5!  16.g4! ... (16.Nxd6 would be OK if White was prepared to settle for a game little more than equal) 16...Nf4! 17.Qb3!  ... The string of fine, unexpected, moves leaves White attacking b7 and g7, and still with the c4 thrust to consider.  However unclear and murky the position arising from 15.Nf5, I reckon White must have had an edge.
,Castling K-side came into consideration.  Now that Black has established communications with both his rooks, White has to concern herself about her willingness to commit to one sector at a time when Black can switch his King to somewhere less exciting.
,Talk about centralisation!  You can not get pieces more centralised than White's right now.  Even so, I still like 16.c4 here: 16...Ne7  17.c5 Bxe5  18.dxe5 Rd8  19.Qa3, with a White knight likely very soon to come in at d6.
,Decentralisation in the face of White's plan looks like a misjudgement.  Possibly Black hoped to unbalance the game, pick up a pawn and trust in the vagaries of blitz play to survive an attack. Maybe.  At any rate, White obtains a small edge.
,[?!] More forcing would have been 17.c4.   White's game seems to be crying out for this move to be played.  White's game is healthy enough that without it she can still keep Black under constraint.  Yet 17.c4 Ne7 (evidently Black loses the knight after ...Nf6 or ...Nb6)  18. c5 Bxe5  19.dxc5 0-0 20.Nd6 ... led to a fine game for White.
,'Preparing' c4?  But that oft-mentioned thrust was playable immediately, as 18.c4 Nb4?? 19.Qb3 would be horrible for Black.  Instead of 18.c4, also possible would have been 18.Qf3, with threats against the knight at h5 and the pawn at f7.
,Also possible was ...Nhf4.  The text seems the more circumspect, though.
,Also 20.c4 was still good.  But White seems now poised to bash her way through the centre to come at Black's King.  In the light of that, Black's next is understandable.
,[??] A terrible misjudgement.  Black has been keeping up, pretty much, for the whole game so far, though 16...Nh5 did some self-inflicted damage. With 20...b5! Black could finally have stymied White's delayed c2-c4 thrust, and been left with a reasonable game.
,[!] At last!  And still strong.
,The only retreat, as after 21...Ne7, 22.Nxf7 would have been good enough to win.
,Creating what I call a 'masked battery' against the Black Queen.  The idea is that the masking piece - the e5-knight - moves aside to attack something else (Ng6 attacking the h1-rook), exposing the bishop's attack on the Queen.  The unmasking of a battery is usually so deadly, the defender has to do something about it before the unmasking.
,On this occasion, there was in fact nothing to be done about it about White's threat ...Ng6.  By saving the Queen in this way, Black will lose his King!  22...g5 would not have helped much (23.Bg3! and the threat remains), but Black might have been able to contain the damage in this line: 22...h5! 23.g5 Ng4  24.Nxg4 hxg4  25.Bxc7 gxf3 26.Bxd8 Kxd8, leaving White the Exchange ahead in the end game.
,[!] One of those moves that 'leaps to the eye' of a tactician.  Black is busted.
,Abandoning her consort.  No good was 23...bxc6 24.Qxc6ch and mate nest move.  But it is mate in two, now, as well.
,A sudden and drastic finish.  During the course of the game, at no time was White under any real pressure or at a disadvantage.  Possibly that explains the strong opponent's lapses in tactical and strategic judgement.  A fine win to White.

"This was played in the first round of the British Over 50s Chess Championships in Llandudno. Although I was out-rated I managed to draw the game.
,I had looked up some of his games, and saw that he played the King's Indian Defence, and I rattled out the first moves very quickly.
,The King's Indian is a hypermodern opening, where Black deliberately allows White control of the centre with his pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it with the moves ...e5 or ...c5. Until the mid-1930s, it was generally regarded as highly suspect, but the analysis and play of three strong Soviet players in particular—Alexander Konstantinopolsky, Isaac Boleslavsky, and David Bronstein—helped to make the defence much more respected and popular. It is a dynamic opening, exceptionally complex, and a favourite of former world champions Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, and Mikhail Tal, with prominent grandmasters Viktor Korchnoi, Miguel Najdorf, Efim Geller, John Nunn, Svetozar Gligorić, Wolfgang Uhlmann, and Ilya Smirin having also contributed much to the theory and practice of this opening. In the early 2000s the opening's popularity suffered after Vladimir Kramnik scored excellent results against it, so much so that even Kasparov gave up the opening after relentless losses to Kramnik. However, Kramnik himself won a fine game on the black side of the KID in 2012, and current top players Hikaru Nakamura, Teimour Radjabov and Ding Liren all play the opening.
,This is Sämisch variation, a subtle blockading system and a critical challenge to the King's Indian.[1] It is named after the German Grandmaster Friedrich Sämisch. The Sämisch has been played by numerous grandmasters, including world champions Mikhail Botvinnik, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov.

Bobby Fischer had trouble against the Sämisch. Mednis' How to Beat Bobby Fischer showed that five of Fischer's losses were against the Sämisch King's Indian, and remarked that Fischer eventually avoided the King's Indian if he believed he would face the Sämisch.[2] Fischer faced the Sämisch five times against Boris Spassky in their 1992 rematch, however—winning two, drawing two and losing one.

In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO), the Sämisch Variation is covered in chapters E80 to E89

,This is where I had to start thinking. Up to now we had been following another game by Mark Page. In that one, black played 10.....b7-b5, white replied c4-c5 and the game was eventually drawn. 10.....Nd7 prepares b7-b5 but prevents c4-c5. I have to play actively before he gets in this thrust.
,So that if he ever plays f5-f4, I will have a lovely e4 square for my knight. 
,Of course not 11....Rxf5?? 12. g4 winning a piece.
,One idea is to divert his f pawn away from protecting the e4 square, allowing me to play Ne4.
,He takes.
,I take back.
,Afterwards my opponent was critical of this move, as giving up a pawn for not enough compensation, but in my opening databases, this has always been played rather than the timid Nf6.
,So I take.
,He takes back.
,and I take back.
,He commented afterwards he wasn't sure if this knight should go to c5 or e5. In my opening databases, it seems that the knight normally goes to e5. OK what would you play now?
,I thought that this was logical, protecting g4, but after the game my opponent correctly pointed out afterwards that 16. Bh6! is much better exchanging his powerful dark squared bishop. If he plays 16.... Bxg4 I simply exchange on g7 and then play 18. Rg1! winning his bishop (if 18...h5 then 19. h3), and if he exchanges first I still have the killing pin on his bishop if he takes on g4.
,I had a long think here. I was looking at Bg5, but eventually came to the conclusion that I was simply driving his queen to a better square and my bishop could be vulnerable on that square. Plus on e3, the bishop could take on c5 in some variations. 
,which is why I retreated.
,Preparing b7-b5. What would you play here dear reader?
,This is what I played, but it is a mistake. I should have played Bd4, exchanging off his Bg7.

"I start off with my usual.
,I am almost in unfamiliar territory here since I'm used to seeing 1...e5, as opposed to, 1...Nc6.
,Therefore, I stick to what I know and try to transpose this into the Spanish Opening, since as we know, it starts off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5.  Given that 1...Nc6 was played, I try to do that.  Now, if I really wanted to, I also could've played 2.Nf3 which did come into consideration.  But, I felt that it was better to try and put some pressure against Tom's Nc6.
,This could still transpose into the Spanish Opening since after 3.Bb5, black often plays this move.
,Therefore, I still try to transpose the opening since this is how white retreats.
,But, this move, however, stops that since Nf3 is often played.  Well, this move prevents that.  This, however, is where I overlook something.
,? That's because in the Ruy Lopez, after 3.Bb5, black often responds with the Berlin Defense.  And, after 3...Nf6, black often castles.  The idea is that after 4.0-0 if 4...Nxe4, white regains the pawn by centralizing his R with 5.Re1.  Well, I am thinking along that same line, but the timing is off, as this move loses a pawn without anything in return.  Better was 4.Nc3, and then after 5.Nf3 it becomes something similar to the Four Knights Opening.
,As noted, I became overly confident with the last move due to the timing being off.  As I was thinking along the lines of 6.Re1 to get the N.  But, Tom stops that by attacking my B.  And, I don't like the position.  Whereas, in a different game I exchanged because it was possible when I was low on time.  The difference here is that I'm not ready to exchange but don't have a choice.
,That's because the only other options were 6.Bb3 or 6.Bxc6.  Now, I overlooked 6.Bxc6 and didn't want doubled pawns on the Q side.  So, I played this.  Where I a little more careful, I would've captured on c6 to double up his pawns. 
,As now, Tom gains tempo here.
,Which gives him a nice spot for his LSB.  And, as we will see which Tom notes in the end, this is starting to become a dangerous position for black because of where the B is placed.
,So, I try to become sneaky, myself, by centralizing my R.
,But, Tom has an answer to that.
,So, the plan is to complete my development.  10.b3 also came into consideration, but I didn't like the looks of 10...g6 as this allows 11...Bg7, to which, Tom would threaten my Ra1 or Bb2.  Therefore, I felt like it ought to be avoided.
,The only problem is his pin on my Nc3.
,So, similar to what we see when it's against the Q or K, I break it with my B.
,Bringing his Queen into play.  At first, I thought that the purpose was to castle on either side.  But, as it turns out, Tom is going to have a dangerous threat that I'm bound to overlook.
,Thinking that Tom might have brought his Q out prematurely, I attack it.
,? And, I keep my N free of the pin.  But, the B would've been better on g5, as this is where Tom's threat becomes nasty.  In fact, although I'm not quite lost yet, Tom now has a big advantage because in order to save the position, I will, at the very least be forced to destroy my pawn structures.  But, it'll only get worse as that's one of the main things that I'm thinking about.
,I was really wondering what to do.  As noted, I'm forced to double up my pawns.  That's because of one variation that I considered which doesn't work.  That variation is what happens after 14...Nxf3.  At first, I thought that it was no big deal because of he did that, I'd take back with 15.Qxf3?? and everything is fine.  But, it would not be because of his Bb7 which means that I almost overlooked 15...Bxf3 leaving me a Q for a piece down.  So, I had to double, and then asked myself what I could do to get out of it.  Unfortunately, I made the wrong as there were multiple threats, but I only saw one being the loss of the Queen.

"The Exchange Variation, popularised by Bobby Fischer. White gives Black the two Bishops in exchange for a slightly better pawn formation. It might have been enough for Fischer; for mere mortals there's a whole middle game ahead...
,Better than 4...bxc6. Now if White captures the e-pawn Black has 5...Qd4, regaining the pawn with a slight advantage.
,Now White has supported his own e-pawn, Black's is genuinely threatened.
,Fischer actually recommended 5...f6, but I thought I'd try this instead, which is perfectly playable, as is 5...Qd6.
,A bit over cautious, I think. White wants to prevent the pin, but would be better completing his development.
,So I can go to g6, adding to the defence of my e-pawn.
,This rather creates a hole on d4. Perhaps the idea is to lure away the Bishop so the e-pawn can be taken?
,I continue with the planned support of the e-pawn.
,White has now made five pawn moves and he still hasn't castled or started to develop his Q-side. This should give me some advantage.
,I've nearly finished developing while White is way behind.
,Still preoccupied with attacking the Bishop.
,I take the opportunity to try to undouble my pawns.
,White obliges...
,Not a bad idea, to seize the long diagonal and renew an attack on my e-pawn. But it allows me a neat tactic...
,Which I miss, as preoccupied with defending the pawn as White is in attacking it; 11...Nf4 attacks the g-pawn and the d-pawn and must win one of them.
,Too late now White has castled!
,A bit of an ugly attempt to defend the d-pawn.
,I see a chance to blow open White's K-side pawns...
,For some reason, here I thought I'd trapped the Rook...
,Completely missing this defence.

,This is the move I wanted analyzed.  I was pretty sure it was over and should have resigned.  Still doesn't look clear that I had any hope even from the discrepancy in the analysis of the two possible moves.  Is 54.Kc6 really that much better?  Maybe only from the point of view that it prolongs the game and allows more time for my opponent to make a mistake.

"Centre Counter, sometimes called the Scandinavian Defence - Scandy by its affectionate devotees.  Directly challenging White in the centre, but there is a bit of a downside.
,OK, but perhaps unnecessarily provocative.  Much more usual is 2.exd5 and if Black recaptures, 2...Qxd5, 3.Nc3 forces Black to move the Queen a second time.  I once won a game in four moves when Black thoughtlessly retreated his Queen to c6, whereat 4.Bb5 pinned his Q against his K.   Much more usual is 3...Qa5, which places the Q on a safe square, but still actively located.
,Good response to White's threat to win the pawn.  Now the knight will have to move a second time.
,Although this encourages Black to hit him again, I think this is probably OK.  3.Ne2 may be met by 3...e5, when Black has the larger share of the centre.  That need not be fatal - more like the colours reversing roles!
,?  I can't tell whether this is a simple 'one-mover' oversight, or a reluctance to move the knight a fourth time.  It were better to have moved the knight a fourth time, and even a fifth - 5.Nh5 g5  6.Ng3.  However 5.Nd3 would have been OK too, threatening to win the e-pawn.
,?  Taking the knight would have been fine for Black.
,This is a mistake, but a bit of calculation is necessary to figure it out.  The sequence isn't deep, but it IS more than two moves.  The problem is that if the bishop's protector, the h6-knight, can be drawn from his post, he can be overwhelmed by numbers, with two pieces attacking the bishop and one defending.  It is a small combination.  See if you can find it.
,?  Rather awkward - White pieces are starting to get a bit tangled in the centre.  Recall the opening guideline - don't move a piece twice in the opening, unless there is a tactic.  Earlier, the knight was being hunted; it had to keep on the move.  Now there is a tactic: 7.Bxf7ch! Black has two reasonable replies: 7...Nxf7 8.Qxg4; OR 7...Kxf7 8.Nxe5ch ... (forking King on f7 and Bishop on g4) 8...Ke8 9.Nxg4 ... Either way, White wins a pawn with a slight advantage.
,Gives up an active piece for one relatively immobile (because it is pinned).  Not usually a good bargain.
,?  Another 'one mover' oversight that costs Black a pawn.  8...Bd6 or 8...f6 or a move by the b8-knight would have been much better.
,The Gameknot engine gives White a 1.88 edge - worth almost 2 pawns - very much the better game.
,Safe enough.  An alternative idea would have been to invite (force) an exchange of minor pieces by 10.Ng4.  Now that she is a pawn ahead, even (i.e. equal) exchanges are in White's interests, in principle.  That does NOT mean simply blindly exchange, of course, nor should Black avoid them if by so doing he incurs worse, but they can be used to add value to White material advantage.
,!?  OK, but I think I would have castled, here.  White does have to be somewhat concerned about the tangled situation on the c- and d-files, too, though their unravelling is not yet urgent.
,?!  Halves White's advantage according to the GK engine.  But I rather like this move - poking a heavy stick into Black's game.  It's a move I might well have played myself in this situation.
,?!  The Gameknot engine prefers 13...Bd6, which places the bishop on a well protected and handier location - a more useful diagonal.
,?  Understandable, given the tangled situation in White's centre, but this puts Black on top.  The recapture will throw White back onto the defensive.  It is not so easy to find a good move, but I might have been inclined to castle, or play 15.Bb3, with a view to relocating to c2, aiming at the h7-square.
,Naturally, there was no good alternative.  Black was attacking the queen, and also c2, where there would have been a knight-fork.  This Queen retreat defends against both threats.
,More forcing - and more worrying for White - would have been 16...b5.  Now White has the opportunity to exploit the pin along the a2-g8 diagonal.  
,At last, and quite understandable.  There will come times at this level of play in which quite complicated tactical situations can arise.  It is very hard to learn to recognise and take advantage of them without having begun with simpler, less complicated motifs and patterns.  The main thing to note is that the f7-knight is pinned by the bishop against the king.  It is defended by a rook and the king.  Could White heap another attacker against the pinned knight?  Yes she could: 17.Ne5!  Could Black in response find another defender?  Only the Queen.  What that means is that White looks to be winning the exchange after 17.Ne5.   ++++++++++++++  As it transpires, this might have led to a wild tactical melee as follows:  17.Ne5! Bd6!  18.Nxf7 Qe7ch (the reason for the bishop move) 19.Kf1 b4  (A piece and a pawn down, Black fights like a tiger to stay in the game) 20.Nh6ch! ... (As you see, this is well beyond 'one-mover' territory, and would be challenging for an experienced tactician to calculate.  Not 20.Nd6ch?? bxc4  21.Nxc4 Rxf2ch 22.Kxf2 Rf8ch  23.Kg1 Ne2ch and Black wins)  20...Kh8 21.Bd5 e6  22.Nf7ch Kg8  23.Qg4! Ne2 24.Be6 Rxf7  25.Rb1 Raf8  26.Bxf7ch Rxf7.  fen=""6k1/4qrpp/2pb4/1p6/p5Q1/8/PPnP1PPP/1RB2K1R w - -"" ++++++++++++++++ I would not expect anyone below Master level to calculate this whole line, so complicated it is.  Myself, I would have decided that something like 17.Ne5 b5  18,Bxf7ch Rxf7  19.Nxf7 Kxf7 won the exchange and left it at that.  I might well have been surprised by the tactical fight Black put up by 17...Bd6!  but 'them are the breaks'.   If you don't see a reason NOT to capture a thing, or win some other advantage, go for it.  If it turns out bad, you will learn to recognise the really unsafe captures. 
,Not a bad idea to bring the rook quickly into action.  Instead, 17...b5 would have forced White to exchange on f7.

"I wasn't sure how Charles was going to open.  As I've also seen him play the Queens Pawn Opening (1.d4), as well as, the English which is just like the Sicilian Defense but in reverse (so 1.c5).  But, once he played this, I was ready to answer with the Sicilian Defense.
,This is all standard and what I'm most used to.
,Trying to take Charles off guard a little, I play this.  The entire idea behind this move is tempo gain.
,Better was 7...Be7 to continue developing and breaking the pin that he has against my Nf6.  The entire idea behind tempo gain was to develop my DSB and castle.  I thought that exchanging gained more since Charles is forced to take back.  But, this didn't gain anything.  In addition, this happened before the lesson with GM Susan Polgar about not exchanging unless there is a definite advantage.  So, I misunderstood a part of that message where Susan said that, in general, exchange N for B.  In a later lesson, she said that you sometimes also need the B, and thus, don't exchange so quickly.  And, that was when I had that chess dream as training from the lord.  He went over the same thing that Kenneth_fiore_3 told me.  So, what Ken said in our first lesson was spot on as that was, in reality, how I was thinking until those important lessons.  With that being said, I believe that this exchange is going to benefit Charles, as my B stronger then Charles N.
,This is where I break the pin and prepare to castle, at once.
,Charles also has development and castling on his mind.  With that being said, we both castle, at once.
,I was thinking very hard about what to do to avoid exchanging.  There was no way around it here, so I decided to complete my development.  But, better would've been to develop with 10...Nbd7  And, when he plays 11.Bxf6, I can recapture with the other N, ultimately, making it stronger.  By playing this, however, the exchange weakens my position.  As now, I'm losing some control of my center.
,I first, I thought that Charles was trying to exchanging.  But, then I asked myself why he'd do that being his N is stronger then his Bc4, in this position.  I also, at first, didn't see the point, being that 13.Nb6?? is unplayable because of my Q.  However, the real reason behind this move is because of what I play next.  After which, the N is not attacked, so he doesn't have to worry about me taking off his stronger N.
,It might look I'm trying to get a passed pawn.  But, the real behind playing this move is due to the N moving since I'm now threatening to win a pawn.
,Not surprisingly, Charles puts a stop to that.
,?? I go after his f5 pawn, as a result.  But, this is a terrible move.  As it is going to expose my K, and I'm going to lose a pawn.  That's because when Charles exchanges, I'll have to recapture with the pawn supporting the K.  Had I refrained from playing this, he would not have captured being that I would take back with the Q.  But, with this interference, I can't use the Q any longer.  So, despite material being even, this gives Charles an advantage.
,As, not surprisingly, this move follows.  But, what's worse is that I'm going to lose a pawn.  As I can't recapture since Charles takes with the Q.
,Knowing what I've done, I try to fix some of the damage by moving the N back out to where I placed it 6 moves earlier.  In addition, I'm preparing to attack Charle's Q, sooner or later.
,Centralizing his R.
,? I considered attacking his Q with 17...Re8.  However, that would've been the only reason for playing that.  But, I would not know what to do afterwards.  What I overlooked was the exchange.  As the idea was to attack Charles B, and force his retreat.  But, without it's protection, I overlooked that he'll take my N.  I then thought that this was just inconvenient, as I've allowed something that I did not desire which was an exchange here.  Shortly after, I thought that it was just the worst being a burden.  But, it's not.  As this is a mistake, being that Charles will win another pawn after exchanging.  So, much better would've been 17...Re8, afterall.
,Being that 19...Rc8? is unplayable due to my a pawn, I come up with a new plan being to mobilize my Q.  The reason being is to allow an attack against his Q.   Even though he attacks my Q first, this was very well worth it to me because of what unfolds.
,And, that's being this move which is what I noted.  And, what's important to note is that my a pawn is still protected.
,What I overlooked is that the attack allows Charles to threaten another pawn.
,? As now, I threaten to exchange which is significant as I threaten mate, afterwards.  I knew that Charles wasn't going to allow that.  But, rather then attack the Q, this would've been better on the last move, as now, it would be very difficult to drive off what unfolds.  The only way to prevent me from winning back material would be 23.Rxe8+ and after 23...Rxe8, Charles must advance his h, g, or f pawn to prevent mate.  In return, that would compromise his position a little, and I would not have lost material.  But, this move gives him another pawn, as he will take on f6 with check.
,Right now, it looks like Charles had prevented the threat that I noted earlier.

"Queen pawn opening. A bit interesting, I suppose. Normally I see e4, but this is equally good.
,To stop e4. 
,Feeling a bit under pressure. I've never had a game where the queen pawn went so far forward.
,Constrained. White is able to move his pieces around quite easily, but I am now unable to develop my bishops and knights where I want them. Would there have been a better move than d6 to allow that?
,I don't want that knight coming down to b5. I'm constrained enough as it is.
,Getting ready to castle kingside. Too much pawn movement on the queenside to justify a castle there.
,Asking for a trade.
,But he declines. Well, at least my knight is pressuring him.
,Not exactly sure why I made this move, but I certainly am glad I did. It will be revealed why later.
,Blunder on my end. Failed to notice that b7 was unguarded, and that White's queen was sitting pretty on b3, ready to take both a pawn and a rook.
,And my rook is gone on the next move. 
,I think I did this hoping he'd go for a trade. However, this move is incredibly important because of what it does to White's queen if it happens to take the rook: its escape route will be cut off (a6 will be guarded by the queen). 
,Traps the queen in! 
,Still, the queen can't escape. My pawns block her way. It's hunting time!
,Just some support here if I need it.
,Seems to pressure me here. I want to be very cautious here, however. Any other pieces that break through could help the queen. So I decide to drive the knight away with a conservative pawn push on h6.
,I notice that I can use my knight only if d7 is open. If I can get him there, I'll be able to threaten Bb6, which would gain me a queen.
,Curses! He saw it, forcing me to...
,delay my capture of the queen. But hey, a free pawn nonetheless. 
,Just what I was worried about! The knight is coming to help out the queen! I have to be very careful with my moves now, I don't want to let the queen escape from my trap.

"The Nimzo-Indian, a defence I've rarely played. But I should; it's direct - Black gets his pieces out quickly to enable fast castling, and often doubles White's pawns.
,White can play 4.Qc2 here to avoid the doubled pawns...
,But in this line White accepts the doubled pawns for a strong pawn centre. It also means Black has no dark-squared Bishop.
,Black must counter quickly in the centre.
,Now my opponent has gone a little astray, but not disastrously so. It's just that advancing the pawn is rather against the spirit of the variation, I would have thought. White's strength is in those pawns, and more usual is 6.e3 or even 6.f3, which I see was the most popular move in the database. Already there are only nine games with this position.
,Now my move is rather against the idea of the opening - swift castling. Instead I develop a piece and in fact don't castle K-side at all.
,The lack of Black's dark-squared Bishop is immediately exploited.
,So the attacker must be driven away.
,And again...
,Black has really seized the initiative now.
,White really doesn't want a second set of doubled pawns, and this is the only way to avoid them.
,A little drastic, but threatening to cut off the Bishop.
,Instead it's driven back.
,At this point we are a few moves out of the databse and I'm unsure of the best continuation. I feel like I'm on top...
,And I'm sure White won't want to take this pawn and saddle himself with pawns that are doubles and isolated.
,He can, however, drive away my Knight quite easily.
,I'm eyeing that open diagonal against the KIng, but I can't see how to exploit it.
,White can actually exploit the fact that I didn't castle when I had the opportunity, and play 14.Qg6+, preventing castling altogether. Instead he tries to challenge in the centre and free his Bishop. But this just loses a pawn.
,16...Qxd4 is better, since White is probably obliged to exchange Queens, but I feel like the momentum is with me...
,White can accomplish what he wants to accomplish by castling Q-side, but probably didn't fancy all that space. In the end, his centrally placed King was his undoing. Curiously, I hadn't even spotted this, which rather forces me back...

19.	Qxe8+	Rxe8
20.	Rxe8+	Kf7
21.	Rf8+
We both thought white didn't have enough. Later analysis shows white is winning. At the time of the game, before his 19th move, I was only looking at 22. Rxa7, but 22. Re1+ is more powerful. 21....Ke6 is forced, as after ....Ke7 22. Re1+ Kd6 23. Rxf6 wins the black queen. After 22. Re1+ Kf5 23. h6 threatens mate, so .....g4 then 24. Rg8 stops the black king escape. Black has to give up his queen to avoid mate. 
,I start to get back into the game. His bishop is better than my knight, but he has got doubles pawns. I should be able to hold this. In an endgame by a pawn could be a valuable asset. I am threatening to play Nd5, hence his next move.
,He prevents my threat. It is also quite a reasonable idea for him to put pawns on white squares to allow his bishop to weave in and out of them.

"To avoid more exchanges, I pull back.
,But, with my Queen attacked, I felt that the only option was to exchange here.  However, I completely overlooked 19.Qc1 because my primary focus was keeping the Queen in the center and right in front of the Rook.
,With that, I felt that it was important to get my N out of the corner and onto a more active square.
,I was a little surprised that ION attacked my Queen, but I guess the model is expecting to be surprised.  With that, I'm ok moving it elsewhere.
,As now, ION's going at it by attacking my N.
,So, I protect.
,I was only worried about my a2 pawn, but that was the wrong way to think.
,?? That's because, I overlooked that my Bg5 is on the same line.  Therefore, this is the losing move.  And, it also turns out that ION could not have taken my a pawn, as he pointed out.  In it, he said, ""Now that is a pity: you were doing so well up to here. The a-pawn wasn't really threatened. After 23...Qxa2 24.Ra1 Qb2 25.Reb1 ... the queen would have been trapped!""
,Against someonelse, I might have stayed and hoped for a stalemate.  But, I knew that I didn't stand a chance against ION.  Plus, I also felt that there was nothing else to learn, so I resigned, under that circumstance as per what reversion and I discussed in Reversion's Open Fire.

"?? So, I took here thinking that it would get me out of trouble.  That's because my thought was that I was safe and felt comfortable.  But, I was wrong, and to take is a mistake here.  What I forgot is that the B is on the same line as the Q.  This means that I overlooked a bigger threat which is a checkmate.  And, by capturing, Tom can and will mate me on his next move.  The best thing was just to accept the destroyed pawn structure, but even then, Tom is clearly winning.  And, I have to try and figure out what to do to save the position.  But, capturing lost, and a threat like this shouldn't have been overlooked.  Instead, I focused too much on those doubled pawns and overlooked the checkmate.
,Right after this game, we played one last game.  After that, we both agreed that there was not enough time to play another game.  I played better in the third game but overlooked a threat that also allowed him to checkmate.  So, instead of being at the top, I was at the bottom of my game which is how I missed the important threats.  Or another way of saying it is that I overlooked what this opponent really wanted to do which was to deliver the checkmates after the tournament game.

"Just a reminder about the time control. It was 40 moves in 90 minutes, after that an extra 30 minutes is added if your time runs out. There is also an increment of 30 seconds per move.
,This was a surprise. My opponent - the number 5 seed in the tournament, and a FIDE Master - the first I have ever played to my knowledge - has played the Benko Gambit.
,And this surprised him, as d4 player he was not expecting me to allow a transposition to a e4 opening.
,The Pirc Defence (correctly pronounced ""peerts"", but often mispronounced ""perk""), sometimes known as the Ufimtsev Defence or Yugoslav Defence, is a chess opening characterised by Black responding to 1.e4 with 1...d6 and 2...Nf6, followed by ...g6 and ...Bg7, while allowing White to establish an impressive-looking centre with pawns on d4 and e4. It is named after the Slovenian Grandmaster Vasja Pirc.
,The usual reply.
,Slightly unusual - black normally plays g6 here.
,No point in going to c4 where it can be hit with b7-b5
,Black stakes a claim in the centre.
,And this is the usual reply
,I can't see this move on any of my databases, and I don't think it is very good! Too many pawn moves! Nb-d7, Be7, g6, exd4, Qc7 and Qb6 have all been played here.
,The setup f2–f3, Be3 and Qd2 is commonly used against the King's Indian Defence and Dragon Sicilian, and can also be used against the Pirc; indeed, this system is as old as the Pirc itself.
,Another strange pawn move. Again, I think Nb-d7, Be7, g6, exd4, Qc7 and Qb6 are all better.
,Maybe I should have continued with my plan of Be3, but I almost felt duty bound to try and exploit his weakening of the g5 square and the fact he couldn't play h7-h6 any more.
,He at last develops.
,And I continue.
,Maybe he was planning c6-c5.
,I exchanged as I was afraid of him exchanging on d4 followed by c6-c5-c4
,He takes back.
,I decide to re-route my knight to e3 and I was thinking about strengthening my centre with c2-c3.
,He develops.

"Bad move? I don't like the light squares weakness, but I guess Bb7 will come shortly anyway. I should have tried g3, Nxd4, Bg2. Nothing special, or do I miss something?
,Playing off mainline, as I like. 
,Not necessarily bad, but what's the plan? He's just showing his cards, and then helping me to make my plan.
,This is inviting Bg4, Qd3, and my action on black's queenside white squares seems more dangerous than black's B on g4, aiming at nothing. True or false?
,The expected one. Now I have it easy, d5, if I don't mind to lose my dsb... which I don't want. 
,The plan was the following: 
,...and black's lsb is very unconfortable on d7.
,Squeezing black in, and providing an escape route for my dsb. 
,What else? Black should have acted quickly on the Q side to counterbalance my increasing pressure, with c6!
,...to d4, controlling c6. 
,I was very doubtful about this move. Bh2 seemed natural. But what if black wakes up on the Q side, and I find my lsb useless in h2, byting granite on d6, while my diagonal is undefended? So I preferred to place it here, so to support d4 and trheaten either to exchange black's lsb for the N or to force e5 (dxe6ep!?)... a classic and juicy situation, with some interest. Stronger players will see the weaknesses better than me...
,Finally, I thought that my attack on the Kside was able to keep him too busy to break on c6. The main reason I didn't take en passant was that after dxe6ep, Bxe6 was just ok for black, and even o-o-o, placing the R on d1, was not really such a great advantage. Was it accurate?
,Well: if c6 now, dxc6, Bxc6 could be interesting for something like Nc4 (attacking d6), but black has Bxe4 in return. So this was not really accurate. More important was Ng3 (g4, and Nf3 can't go to h5 or NxN, opening the lines). 
,b3 is always there, but what happens if I use the R into the K side, instead, making his move a plain loss of time?
,Here, because I sensed that my plan had to include f4, even opening the diagonal for him. So the R will be useful there. Against Bb5, c4. 
,Now, I have to be coherent. If dxc6, I just help him, and without the R in d1 it is just a step worse than before. I have to go on with my plan. Will white get to attack faster than black? Let's see: if g5, Nh4. I have to play the Ng3 first. But I didn't see that plan: I saw a worse one. 
,f4, of course, and hope he doesn't manage to exchange pawns on the Qside. ""Hope chess"", as we know... well, it was not exactly ""hope""... let's call it ""intuition"". The think that so often fails at chess. The thing I missed was that...
,...Ne2, not forseen to be moved, is hanging, and if I defend with...
,Returning to a more active place, as before, and preventing h4. Now he has a break point with b5, but I have...
,I know my b2 pawn is now weak because of c4 (it was the downside, of course) but black is far from being able to get his Q over there... is it?

"The basic Icelandic gambit scenario. There are several improvements for white, this is the ""confident"" one...
,Black can't take the pawn d4 with the Q. After BxB, Qxb2 is refuted by Bc3. 
,Bxc4+(disc.) is theatened. If BxB, QxB+, Qd2, a5? gives black a nice game, despite the doubled pawns. 
,My N is dreaming on c2+, and tempts white into the naive fork...
,On a blitz game, I'm not able to calculate everything, but I sensed the melee will come in my favour somehow. 
,The Q will be controlling c2+ AND shielding white from Bg4+. White tries to escape via...
,I can't leave it as a Q's exchange, of course, I'm forced to go on. 
,White is forced to remove her Q or lose it. 
,My Q is inmune, due to Nc2+, NxQ. But in this case, I could just remove the B from e6 and save the day. Neverhteless, it would allow Na6...
,...and now I win the Ra1 AND I save my bishop. 
,...like this. Of course, white can try...
,And, incredibly, he does. Now, the wonderful consecuence of this is that my other N is ready to theaten... Nxf2+, winning the other R too... :-)
,...I well know that Na1 is lost, and I won't spend time moving it. I'll let white spend moves for grabbing it. 
,The only sensible move. Now, we enter a very ""serious"" endgame. More strategic than tactic. But still, if I believe to the +1600' rating of my opponent, I should be a little proud of the outcome. Unfortunately, I doubt you can reach this rating being so unprepared on this opening. // Here, my K can go to d7. Somehow, I felt I had to spend my tempoes building some threat. The key must be the exposed position of the WK, so I have to open the game, using my R on the central columns. 
,I'm not worried by Nb5 (a6).
,Expected. Nf6 doesn't convince me too much. True is that it controlles a possible c4. The check only helps his K to move away from my R's column... BUT WAIT, now I see that Ne5+ would have been almost a winner, after: 17... Ne5+, Kmust go to 18. d5 (or Nxc4). Rh-e8, and black threats c5+, Ke5 (forced, e.p. is impossible due to the Rd8), and black's attack seems unstoppable. Did I miss it? 
,My targets were g2 and e3.
,f6 is not possible due to Ne6. But after he takes on h7, f6 will make her lose the piece after Rh8.
,So let's take it, come on! Any of them. I'll sac a pawn but I'll conquer the e column and, possibly I'd be able to get both R on the 2nd rank. 
,...unfortunately, my plan had a flaw. Can you see it?

"One of the weakest answers, since it blocks lsb's action.
,The basic Icelandic asset. 
,Another thematic second-best move. My opp. is testing my knowledges.
,...or Qe7. White will lose his d4 pawn or the exchange.
,White must defend f2.
,Qe7 is another playable move here. My answer is forced: Qxb2 is just ugly.
,Here, the only thing I'll get would be his K exposed while I will be able to castle. But is more than nothing, with a stronger opponent! But it is true that, looking closely, now ...BxB+, 10. KxB, Qd4+, threatening b2, may whorth a look. 
,Now it comes the problem: how to continue? Do I grab the centered K advantage? I decide yes, but Nc6 can be interesting, in view of 11. Bf3? (BxB+, KxB, Nd4+, exchanging the Wlsb). But he won't have fallen for it. 
,Now what? o-o is probably right, but I wanted to be sure he won't grab so much space and action with his lsb, so I dared to play...
,...weakening b7. Now, if Bf3, Nc6, and I'll accept gladly the doubled pawns keeping the only lsb on the board. Was it a good decision?
,He apparently didn't see too much advantage in grabbing the diagonal, and, very ""old-schoolisly"", developed. 
,Now, I want to win a tempo by castling Qside and chech him. But h6 should be on my agenda.
,He, righly, protects my N's possible entryon b4. This allows me to play Na5, threatening the fork check on b2. I missed it, unfortunately. 
,...but now I set another treat, and I get a wonderful center occupation. 
,If white plays b4, I'd play Bh3. Either bxB, RxB, or Bf1 (otherwise, Bxb2 forks N and R), and I can retire the B where I like to. He is threatening h7 here, but it is doubtful he can release the B after g6, in the long run. 
,The idea is that if Bxh7, BxN and after g6 the B is trapped. Not so simple, though...
,Ouch!
,Protects f7, threats the B, ""forcing""...
,Now, white will lose a piece, after f6... doesn't he?
,The problem here is that after my B retires, f4 and my N has to go, and f7 falls. If I defend it with Be6, NxB and, again, f4 saves the material for him. I had two choices here: Bf5 (g4, Bd3!?), or...

"A Nimzo-Indian according to my opening books. The main ideas of this opening are: Black will generally be prepared to relinquish the bishop pair by playing Bxc3. As dynamic compensation, Black often doubles White's c-pawns, which represent a static weakness, and gains play against the central light squares d5 and e4, even in those instances where White is able to recapture with a piece after ...Bxc3. Black will aim to close the position to reduce the scope of White's bishops. To this end, Black must blockade the white pawn centre from advancing and neutralize White's attacking chances on the kingside. 
,This move deviates from my book line. 9.Nf3 is the normal continuation from here but there is nothing wrong with this.
,Thematic for this opening, as I plan to reduce the scope of White's bishops and close the position. 
,So I take control of the light squares and prepare to move my king to the queenside. This will allow me to keep myself protected for some time as white tries to penetrate the kingside.
,?! - GK gives this move an inaccuracy saying Qh4 is better.My plan though was to have white get rid of the knight and allow me to continue the plan of closing the position. I see no big issue with Qh4 though.
,With the sound structure of my own pawn chain, I have cut the scope of White's dsb and will continue my attempts at closing this position. Basically still following the theory of the opening. 
,An interesting idea that could be a game changer would be 15.Qxd5?! Nxd5 16.c4 Nb6 where white has a very strong pawn structure.
,A critical attacker gone! Now to finish my plan and get my king safe by castling queenside. Then I will look to capitalize on positional advantages.
,With this, I am guarding against an assault on my kingside and allowing my rook to come to h6 and sweep over to the queenside for my attack plan. 
,This was a 2-fold plan: make White retreat and allow my rook to come and control the b-file. Note that if the rook retreats, I win a pawn.
,But White has seen at least part of what I wanted to do.
,Well, this knight's job is done. Time to take away another defender, weakening d4.
,Now I was expecting d5 to protect the vulnerable centre pawn. Instead...
,This is played. Not a problem. The position is held equal.
,Now again, d5 is the expected move. However...
,? - A miscue. It strengthens the pawn chain yes, but this wasn't the time for a waiting move, especially considering how vulnerable the centre was. 25.d5 was correct.
,The g3 miscue allows me to win the centre d4 pawn. And white's once formidable structure is about to crumble.
,We are approaching a very interesting endgame now. White is a pawn down, but has an impressive chain. I now have activity in the centre and all my pawns are connected. Game on!
,White plans to weaken Black's chain. An interesting idea. Note how I have made the white rook stationary.  There is no way to safely penetrate. Black has taken control.
,Moving the king closer to the action.

"Another rundown on the Hungarian variation in the Sicilian; this time we will try to follow the book... at this level, Kindergarten is over...
,we learned from earlier experience, that this is the best way to go after Nc3... my preferred e6, Ne7, 0-0, to prepare d5, will soon fail in the absence of a6... maybe, I should incorporate a6 somewhere in this variation...
,pretty flawless game from both players up until now, in this closed Sicilian... White however, is giving Black an opportunity that cannot be missed... White had no better than Bxg4, Bxg4, h3, Be6, Bd4, with a slight edge; this Bishop will get very busy in the future, losing lots of tempo...
,after Qxc3, of course Qxg5...
,harsh as it is, this is Whites' best move, eg. Bxf6, exf6, Qd4 (Qxd6??, Bg4), f5, exf5, Bxf5, Bf3, d5; all other options are failing also... Black has taken the initiative, and earned a dangerous advantage on the a-file...
,a bad decision: White should have played Rxa7 or Bc4...
,with c4 locked against c5, both of Whites' bishops have no real play left; for a very long time, as we will soon learn... this might well be the turning point in this game, favouring Black...
,the start of a winning march...
,not the best of choices... better was Rb8!, Nf6 (Nxb8??, Qxe8+ and White is winning), Qb6!, Rd7...
,this settles all; White has lost all advantages... after Rxb7?, Qxd5, cxd5/exd5, Rxb7, Black is winning...
,now, the free a-pawn will march...
,this closes up the b-file for White; all squares from b3 to b8 are in Blacks' control, and both Whites' Bishops are out of play...
,another useless move from this Bishop, while Black is taking over the b-file...
,it is hard for White to find a continuation; this is not one of the best... the only real attack Bh6 - threatens Qg7 mate - is happily countered with Qf6, Qxf6, Nxf6... safest way to go is Qa1/e1, Bc6 - always, or else f6 - Qf1, Qe5, Be3, Rb8, and sit this one out....
,preparing Ne5 and Rb8... c4 is getting into trouble, alongside e4, and also f6, g5, etcetera is in the air, countering an eventual f4...
,probably best...
,tougher was Rb1, to prevent an immediate Rb8... might follow f5, exf5, gxf5, Kf1, a3...
,there was nothing to gain in Qa5, Nd7... this move gives an opportunity to force trading Queens, and Black is happy to oblige...
,forces Bd2, because of Nxf3+, Qxf3 (forced, otherwise Qxc3), Qxa1+; next is Nd7...

"But, Charles refuses.  Which means that to take would be a mistake here.  As now, Charles goes on a different attack.  Maybe, the idea is to put pressure against the King since ION is putting pressure, as well.
,Defending means exchanging like crazy.  This shows that despite being behind, ION is more then happy to liquidate.  My inference is that he's got a winning advantage.  If so, that would not surprise me because it appears that his pressure is overwhelming. 
,This shows it.  Surely, Charles will get out of check, but ION has some nasty surprises here.  For example, he will win back the Queen for a piece, after these checks.  That's the beauty to some of this.
,Meanwhile, Charles goes for another pawn.
,Because this is an endgame, Charles is willing to give it up since the K is a powerful weapon.
,Continuing the K+P+R endgame by moving his King up.
,And, ION is aiming to get another pawn.
,As the saying goes, ""Passed pawns must be pushed"".  That is even at the expense of another pawn, since Charles goal is to promote.
,But, ION is putting a stop to that.  And, it starts with a couple of checks.
,And, it continues by exchanging Rooks.
,Doing what he can to keep the a6 pawn well with the idea of promoting.  So, Charles attacks the Rook, in the process.
,If Charles can't promote his a pawn, then he goes for plan B which is to promote to the d pawn.
,But, ION puts a stop to that.
,With that being said, Charles goes back to plan A, as he hands ION the d pawn.
,As now, Charles will promote.  But, can be stopped?  We will find out soon.
,The answer is yes.  For once, Charles promotes, ION will take, and thus, will win the exchange.
,Protecting his e5 pawn, in case, Charles plays Rd5.
,Instead, Charles uses his K.  The idea is to do what he can to win that pawn, and support the with the K to promote.  As the idea is getting unstoppable promotion.
,But, ION goes for it by pushing his passed pawn.

"Bird's Opening. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird's_Opening
,The most common reply. Black may challenge White's plan to control e5 immediately by playing From's Gambit (1...e5). However, the From's Gambit is notoriously double edged and should only be played after significant study, and black has to be ready for a transposition to the King's Gambit with 2. e4.
,This is considered the main line
,And so is this.
,Black completes the fianchetto.
,Slightly unusual, normally a sign that white will adopt a Stonewall formation with pawns on d4, e3, and f4 and attempt a kingside attack.
,This is a bit unusual too. My plan is e7-e5 and if he stops it with d2-d4 I can play Ng8-f6-e4 and support it with Nd7-f6.
,But he doesn't stop it.
,So I play it!
,He takes.
,I take back.
,He castles.
,Of course avoiding Nf6??? 8. Nxe5!
,Attacking my knight - but giving himself a weak e pawn, backward on a semi-open file, and a weak e4 square.
,Fritz actually prefers Nxf3, but I am not convinced - that exchange seems to help with rid himself of his weaknesses. I am planning Nf6-e4 at some stage.
,This seems a mistake - white is forcing black to castle, which black wants to do anyway. 
,So I castle.
,This is an interesting combination, but ultimately unsound. White gains two pawns, but in return his knight is doomed on a8.
,So I take.
,Knight comes in.

"In my younger days I never opened with this move. It has the reputation of being less aggressive than 1. e4, probably undeservedly.
,The most common reply. It is my usual reply as well, although I am tossing around the idea of switching to the Slav, as I have been having trouble against it recently.
,I've also played 2. Bg5, although my results with it have been less than wonderful, to say the least.
,I used to find this scary, but my recent results against it have been encouraging.
,Personally I think accepting the gambit here is too dangerous. In this line White is willing to give back the pawn, but wants to make Black work for it.
,Much to my surprise, the Gameknot analyzer considers this to be not merely an inaccuracy, but a mistake. The machine prefers 5. … ab5 and calls it even.
,I don't think Black's position is that terrible here. He has eliminated White's central pawn and has a majority of pawns in the center, although at the cost of weakening the King side. IF Black is careful, this shouldn't be a big problem. But as this game demonstrates, that's a big if.
,This is a natural enough move, although other moves, such as 7. … Bb7 and 7. … Be7 have been tried with success.
,In view of White's next move, 8. … Be7 probably would have been a better try.
,Not a move I would have considered except for when I stumbled across the games Tatai vs. Bellon Lopez and Solonzhenkin vs Bistrikova, both of which led to victories for White.
,The point of White's last move is that capturing the e pawn is too dangerous. Best is probably 9. … Bc7 as in Tatai vs. Bellon Lopez or the ignominious retreat 9. … as recommended by the Gameknot analyzer. 9. … Nbd7 was tried in Solozhenkin vs. Bistrikova, but this simply drops a pawn without much compensation.
,I thought this move was natural enough, but 12. Bc4 was stronger. My Smallfish analyzer evaluates the position as +1.1 after that, as opposed to +0.5 after 12. Qh5.
,Forced.
,Finally the Bishop retreats to where it should have been all along.
,It would have been nice to be able to play 14. Nxc5, but White is embarrassed after 14. … Rf5. At any rate, White's knight already has designs on Black's King and is not to be distracted by the pickin's on the Queen side. Smallfish prefers here 14. Qg6 Qe8 15. Qxe8 Rxe8 16. Be3.
,The Gameknot analyzer passed this over without comment, but Smallfish says it is much worse than 14. … ab5. After Black's move in the game, Smallfish puts White at +1.5 as opposed to +0.2 after 14. … ab5.
,The problem with this move is that now White has d3 for his Bishop. Best was the ignominious retreat 15. … Qd8
,Strong enough, one would think, but Smallfish found 16. Bxh6! The point is that on 16. … gh6, then 17. Qg6+ Kh8, 18. Qxh6+ Kg8, 19. Qg6+ Kh8, 20. O-O-O and Black is helpless against the dual threats of Rd5! and Rd3
,A bad blunder which loses immediately. Black has to give up a pawn with 16. … Nd7
,Strong enough, one would think, but again I missed a stronger move: 17. … Bc3! I was fixated on the possible Bishop sac on h6.

"A four knights opening.  Old but it can be interesting.

,White has to take 6. Ba4 is met by 6. ..., b5,  7. Bb3, b4 and the pawn on e4 falls.  

,Threatening 8.  d4xe5, d6xe5, 9. Qd1xQd8, Kxd8  10. Nxe5

,The knight on d4 has a nice central position so black kicks the knight.  Going back to f3 allows the pin with 9. ..., Bg4 and other retreats don't look all that appealing.

,Yes the pawn is weak and it actually could impede a king side assault instead of help it, but the e-file is open.  Black should play Be7 and castle before any real pressure builds.  

,Black immediately attacks the f pawn, but this is a mistake. White defends the pawn and attacks the rook on a8.  This is a slight gain of time that white needs.  ( Although Re1 check immediately might have been even better. )
,A natural move that was expected it seems to attack the b2 pawn and saves the rook.  However it leaves the pawn on a6 undefended and if black had played 11. ..., Ra7 he would've had an easy way to counter the coming pin.

,Black wants to castle but that would leave the bishop on e7 vulnerable.  The pawn on f5 is defended indirectly because the capture on e7 would be mate and white also can now take the pawn on a6.

,Black perhaps wants to take on f5 and he also wants to increase the protection for the bishop on e7.  However 14. Nd5 keeps the pressure up.

,If the rook were on a7 this move would have solved all his problems earlier.  But hindsight is always wonderful.

,Taking with the queen allows 16. Qd1 (or Qd2) winning the queen for a rook so he has to recapture with the knight.

,This is obvious.  By threatening the pinned knight black must take and give up any hopes of a safe castled position.

,White could take on a6 but keeping the pressure on e7 and focusing the bishop on f6 is the priority.
,This is the only way to defend the f6 pawn. Black has spent a lot of tempo's on the knight to have it back on its original square.

,White decides to get the material even and create a passed pawn on the a-file that may come in useful.  At first I thought black might trying to start a king side attack, but actually he wants to protect his f pawn and get out of the potential fork.

,Closing off the bishop's diagonal is a good idea.  I think he should have played this a move earlier.
,This indirectly prevents d4 since 21. ..., d4, 22, Bxd4, c5xBd4, 23. Rxd4  pins the queen to the king and wins the queen and two pawns for the bishop and rook.
,Black still wants to protect f6 and redevelop the knight.  There is also a potential threat to the pawn on c2.  White has a winning move but misses it.

,White was thinking of Rf3 but now he finds the winning move.

,The knight and the rook on b8 both hang and black can't save both.

,He defends d6. Now when I played Ke3 I though that 38. Nf6 won. 38....Re7 is forced. I thought that after 39. Kf3 I was threatening both the rook on g2 and the pawn on d6, but he has Rd2 saving the rook and protecting d6.
,So I tried this, with a similar threat. If 38....Rxc7 39. Bxd6+ although even there he has Rd7 winning.
,But he chose this way to win.
,I stop his Rg2 from protecting the d pawn.
,But this simple move wins easily.
,I hit his rook.
,I am just the exchange and a pawn down. I played it out, but really it is hopeless now. Further comment is unnecessary.

"I don't make any inaccuracies in this opening, but slowly my first-move advantage slips away and Black gets quite a lead. And then messes it up - or does he?
,Unusually passive reply from my opponent! It does stop my Knight getting ideas about going to g5, as if it would!
,Perhaps 5.Nc3 was better? I didn't fancy the tactical complications should Black take the e-pawn and then play d5.
,We both develop normally, and I see the advantage of Black having the dark-squared Bishop on e7, behind the pawn chain. It doesn't get driven back and can join a K-side attack.
,Now I'm the one being over-cautious, preventing the pin on the Knight. But Black has more aggressive plans than a mere pin.
,Attempting to double my pawns and removing the Bishop that's aimed at the King is not a bad idea!
,I can't prevent the exchange, but I can ensure my pawns don't get doubled.
,Preventing 9...b5. But I've rather handed the initiative to Black.
,Another attempt to double pawns.
,So I retreat.
,Allowing the Queen the option of heading to the Q-side and preparing for a possible d5.
,I get back to f3, having made four moves to prevent the doubling of my pawns, which doesn't see too good a deal, in retrospect. But now my dark-squared Bishop is free.
,Back on the Q-side, Black is opening a file for his Rook.
,I can't see a problem with allowing an open a-file, since my Rook is on it as well.
,This seems the best square for the Bishop, even though it doesn't actually threaten anything. And I have to move it to give my Rook a defence.
,Black has conceded control of the a-file, but taken my Queen away from the main game.
,Black is looking for exchanges, being happier in the endgame.
,For the present I want to keep my Bishop on the board.
,I can see Black is setting up an attack on my h-pawn, which I had no real need to advance. I don't fancy allowing him to open up my position, even for a point advantage...
,So I defend with ym King too.

"This is where the position had become corrupt.  As at first, this was recorded.  But, then, I got confused and changed the notation to 46.Ng4? being played first.  After careful review, I determine that this was played first.  As I know why I didn't move the N first.  Moving the N would lose the a pawn.  And, on top of the pawn, this one, believe it or not, is also going to help me to win the game, as we'll see later on.
,This was played right after since Jack, in response, moved the a pawn.  So, we're back on track.
,This is also where, at first, it got confusing.  After figuring out how this was pretty much played from the last move on, I had a difficult time remembering if I played f4, or Ng4 first.  The results would've been the same either.  But, it would have been a transposition as this would've been played on the next move, as opposed to the other way around.  But, how I figured it out, is that I went to the original notes, V. the changes that I made.  This, is what was originally notated.  So, I went by that because the original is more accurate.  That's because with one move, it was all of the other changes that corrupted the position.  That is when I realize that accept for one move, I figured it out, and thus, picked from where I left off in the 5 day period. 
,What I also knew, while figuring it out is that even if it had been the other move, this was definitely played right after 47.f4.  
,Another factor is that had this been played first, Jack's next move would've protected the same way.  So, it would've been 47.Nf4, Rc2 48.f4, Rdc7.  But, as I mentioned earlier, I went by what was originally notated (before that little change) to determine exactly how it was played.  For, right after Jack's next move...
,I take right here because of the threat on his d6 pawn and then some which is bound to become a reality.  That's not to mention that with it, it is also where I start to compensate for lost material and start to build from there.
,I knew that Jack one of his Rooks.  But, I also had a difficult time determining which Rook he used to deliver check.  But, after further studying which took an equivalent to an hour or two, I concluded that this is the Rook that he used.  And, you'll find out how I made that determination later on.
,This is one of the very few times, where what I originally notated was incorrect.  The original was that 50.Kf4 had been played, instead.  However, this is the move that I made as it gives my Rd5 additional support.  The idea being is that a pawn with K and R all working together in the endgame is very dangerous.
,After the last check, it took me even longer to figure out which Rook Jack used to check again.  It took, at least, 2 hours.  But, I concluded the he used this Rook, as you'll find out soon.  And, that starts with the fact that this will be his last check for a few moves.  After starting to sort things out and in the process, this is was the hardest move to figure out from, what was, a corrupt position.  Since I was able to do it, that's when I realized that this is, most certainly, how the game was played.
,With that, this move was forced.
,With that Jack continues to push his passed pawn.
,How I determined that 50...R7c4+ was played, as opposed to, 50...R3c4+ is one fact.  The reason being is because, as noted, Jack didn't check before this move.  With that, his Kce7 and one of his Rooks would be forked.  And, I would've taken advantage of that fork because after 52...Kd7, I would've played 53.dxc7, as opposed to, what unfolds.  The best part now is that not only have I leveled out the game, but I went from losing to now winning. 
,What unfolds is this move.  The reason behind it is because it wins another pawn.  Of course, I keep his next move in mind.  But, unlike before, the upcoming fork is of no concern to me thanks to my d6 pawn.  As it will have access to the promotion.  What that all boils down is the importance of mobility as emphasized by Ken in our second training game, as well as, what he mentioned in an annotation shortly after.
,With that, I keep pushing my pawn.
,In response, Jack holds off by checks this way.  And, this is where I determined that 49...R2c3+ was played, instead of 49...R7c3+  Had he checked on the seventh, it would not have been possible to check without losing material.  That's because instead of on f3 which is where it was, it would've on f2 which loses the N right away.  So, given that circumstance combined with the check that I delivered on d6 by capturing which was difficult, that's where I determined what unfolded.
,As I get out again.
,Not surprisingly, Jack checks again.
,Since the f file is blocked by the Rook, I had to move my K to the h file.
,In which, Jack pushes and prepares to promote.
,And, I promote at once.  I didn't even look at 57.Nxh2??, but it's a good thing that I didn't play this because he would've won back material, after 57...Nxh2.

,Knight retreats.
,Rook develops.
,I thought that I was developing the Bf1 to an attacking post, but this may very well be a losing error. What does black play now?
,Black also had an alternative in 15.....d6-d5 but it ""only"" seems to win a pawn after 16. Be2 dxe4 17. 0-0 and Fritz regards the position as plus .74 for black, and indeed, after a few minutes prefers 15.... Bb7 as the second best move for black (+.77) while it regards the position as +2.37 for black after this move. Now if I take the knight 16. fxe4 Rxe4 and if I save the bishop on d4 with 17. Be3 Rxc4. So I thought that if he is winning the knight back anyway, I may as well take the pawn with check to maintain level material.
,So I take.
,He takes back.
,I threw in a check. I was rather surprised that he just didn't retreat the knight with a discovered check, but what he played was good enough.
,Which was simply to retreat the king. Firitz actually thinks this is the best move.
,I took his knight.
,I am not sure why he didn't simply take my bishop on d4.
,So I take back. This is in fact a mistake. Black could have kept his deficit to managable proportions by just giving up a pawn and exchanging on g7 and then castling.
,Threatening to take the e pawn and stopping me from castling. Fritz prefers 19....Rb5 or 19....Qd5
,Protecting e4 and attacking the queen. What would you do as black now?
,Again Fritz prefers 20....Bc3+! 21. bxc3 Qxc3+ 22. Ke2 Be6 and black has a raging attack.
,And this is yet another mistake! Best for white according to Fritz is 21. Qe3 Bxb2 22. Qb3+ Be6 23. Qxb2 Qxc5 24. 0-0 and white is still in the game, a pawn down. Fritz also prefers 22. Qc1
,He attacks my queen.
,I try to stay protecting my bishop, but....
,And white has to give up the bishop. I would normally resign here, but at 25 minutes each, and no increment, who knows what may happen? I played it out quickly, until I was mated eventually.

,La fase di bonaccia continua.
Ora è il momento di costruire lo schieramento per un finale nel quale, il mio alfiere in più in più deve diventare basilare per la vittoria.
Mi aspetto ora a3. Stefano dever cominciare a far valere la superiorità numerica (relativa) dei pedoni sul lato di donna (non su quello di Re come avevo erroneamente scritto). 

,Sì, in effetti a3 è l'unica mossa che segua un piano. Ho valutato la possibilità di rompere le scatole al cavallo nero con la torre, ma temo che servirebbe solo a portarlo in c3 o c5, dove probabilmente intende andare, e a distrarre la mia torre dal compito di tenere il re nero fuori dai giochi.
Che cosa mi aspetto? Cc3 o Cc5 per ora non servono, e si possono fare dopo. e5? O una spinta dei pedoni g e h? Tanto per alzare il Fön su questa calma piatta. 
,Poichè penso che Stefano, oltre alla spinta dei pedoni nelle fasce esterne, abbia la possibilità di un piccolo raid di disturbo con la sua torre, dopo lo spostamento del cavallo (azione improbabile ma sempre possibile) in e5, blocco subito le velleità interponendo il mio cavallo sulla verticale f.
Al momento c'è solo l'attesa che il bianco apra qualche breccia per far valere la mia superiorità materiale sulla scacchiera, cosa che, nolente o dolente, dovrà fare  
Mi aspetto h3 o b4. Le armate stanno per scontrarsi?

Al momento c'è solo l'attesa che il bianco apra qualche breccia per far valere la mia superiorità materiale sulla scacchiera, cosa che, nolente o dolente, dovrà fare  
Mi aspetto h3 o b4. Le armate stanno per scontrarsi? 

,Mi aspettavo h3. Comunque la musica non cambia di molto. Ora Stefano inizierà l'attacco sul lato di donna con i pedoni. Sono pronto  
A cosa miro? Spostare il Re nel lato di donna e impedire la mobilità dei pezzi bianchi. Almeno spero  


,Prima di iniziare l'attacco coi pedoni, sposto il re dalla colonna c, per evitare il 'pin' (come si dice in italiano?):

34. c5 bxc5
35. bxc5 Tc6

Che cosa mi aspetto? Rf7, oppure Tc6 che mi farebbe cambiare completamente i piani. 
,Continua lo spostamento, lento ma sicuro, del mio Re.
Sevo spostare il mio Monarca sul lato dove Srefano è un po' più forte per dare manforte alla mia armata. Seguo lo schema paventato anche da Stefano... fino a quando non lo so  
,Miro ad avere due pedoni passati e affiancati, via la probabile combinazione:
35. ... bxc
36. Cxc5
Non credo che Klaus sacrifichi l'alfiere per staccare i due pedoni. Piuttosto credo che punterà sul pedone passato e.
	
,Ora aspetto

36. Cxc5, AxCc5
37. bxc5 Td3+

Ho studiato la serie di mosse prossime. La mia torre è intenzionata a eliminare i pedoni in g e h, mentre il mio pedone in e diventare una minaccia incombente.
Se ti va bene fino alla mia mossa 37, puoi continuare proponendo la 38. Hai visto giusto. Anche perché i due pedoni in a e b non mi incutono quel gran timore  
,.

,da diekonige:  ...se a un certo punto ci farete gustare l'avvicinarsi del matchpoint no comment? Cioè intendo, è previsto così? In generale trovo questa attività che state svolgendo interessantissima. 

Non temere, Salvatore, il momento del match point è vicino, ormai i miei piani, se se ne può parlare in tal senso, contemplano la ""carica contro le mitragliatrici"" o poco più. E sappi che io e Klaus abbiamo già in mente altre battaglie, pardon partite di studio per voi 😉

Confermo le mosse da te pronosticate, Klaus, fino alla 37, poi muovo 38. Rb4, per tenere il mio re vicino ai pedoni e impedire alla torre avversaria di mettersi alle loro spalle. La mia sola speranza è che Klaus sia sufficientemente distratto dai suoi piani, da consentirmi, dopo Tc1, di lanciare il pedone c verso le trincee nemiche. Mi aspetto Re7. 
,Diciamo che la situazione di Stefano non è così rosea. Rb4 secondo me, studiando le prossime mosse (da 10 a 15), è una mossa debole. Ok non compromette quello che lo è già, ma forse intravvedo una perdita inutile di tempo che mi aiuta a incentivare la mia formazione d'attacco. Rb2 o Ra2, sempre secondo me, era migliore.
Sposto il mio Re in posizioni ottimali. Non dimentichiamo che, una volta uscite di scena le Donne (come spesso nella vita  ) i Re diventano i pezzi più forti. 
Ora mi aspetto Te1 per bloccare il mio pedone sfascia trincee. Ma una torre obbligata a controllare un unico pedone non cade in depressione?  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commento di Stefano: Ciao a tutti. Mi fa piacere avere la riprova che eravate in tanti a seguirci, e che abbiate apprezzato i nostri commenti mossa per mossa. Sono d'accordo con voi sul fatto che questa partita ha ormai detto tutto, sia come risultato che come didattica. Perciò, se anche Klaus è d'accordo, la possiamo interrompere qui. È stato un onore per me!
E visto che ci state prendendo gusto, ho una nuova proposta. Una partita basata sulla 'modern defence' o 'Robatsch defence', in cui la prima mossa è 1. e4 g6, e Klaus stavolta tiene il bianco. Penso che sia interessante e divertente. Ma vorrei sentire cosa ne pensate su questo thread prima di aprire il nuovo.

"Unlike yours truly, who is old-fashioned, my opponent is a ""modern"" man.
,I preferred this to Nc3, because: it controls squares that are attacked by the Bishop on g7, it provides extra protection to d4, and it allows me to support d4 with c3 if needed.
,Expecting ... d6, this move already put me out of book, so I had to improvise. I'm guessing the point of this move is to support d7-d5 and allow the Queen to attack my pawns from b6.
,Without much knowledge on the Modern defence, I decided I should just take my big center, castle as quickly as possible, and only then start worrying about a plan.
,Here, I obviously have to do something about the d4 pawn.
,My opponent is giving me a chance to open up the game when his King is still in the center, so I should definitely seize this oppportunity.
,""What 'cha gonna do?"" Harry asked the Bishop.
,I expected Black to try trading Queens and go into an endgame, but my Queen just chills here for the rest of the game and lets the underlings do the dirty work.
,The bishops have excellent range.
,With only my rooks left to develop, I should take over the one open file.
,Anticipating the Knight to come to c5.
,Now I start seizing space on the Queenside.
,This prevents ... a5 and my knight will soon find a dominant outpost.
,I'll be in trouble if a Knight lands on f4 ...
,After this, the Knight on rim got stuck there for the rest of the game.
,Black cannot allow my Bishop to reach c5.
,Bilbo Baggins has invaded the Queenside!
,I actually expected this shot. It's Black's only try for the initiative, otherwise he will continue to be squeezed.
,Here, I decided I should let Black capture my dark-squared Bishop, which has a bleak future in the position.
,My opponent admitted that he did not see this tactical shot. The idea is the intermediate move Nc6 if he captures the bishop. On the other hand, if he captures the knight, he'll be a pawn dawn and his dark squares will be weak after Bxd4.

"With this move, it's too late, as I must protect.
,Because there was only, at most, 4 minutes before having to leave, I viewed as a blunder.  I didn't see the point.  And, I did the unthinkable.
,?? That was, taking his Rook at once.  And, with what I mentioned, nothing else came into consideration because the attitude that I don't normally have is that I have fully compensated for lost material and then some.  As I was as confident as you'd get which I have gone wrong with that attitude, but that doesn't include that is this obvious.  However, it might as well be that I missed the threat, for had I defended, the game would've remained unfinished because I was, pretty much, out of time to continue playing.  So, the truth is that I had less then a minute here as it was close to noon.  And, that's not to mention packing up and getting ready to leave due to my work schedule.  When the game was over, Jack was enraged with my play here.  And, he accurately pointed out that best was 29...Rg8  However, if I just had only one more minute, I would've seen the threat.  By playing this, it was over, at once.
,And, I resigned here, as Tom is going to mate on h7, at once.  What I overlooked is that I can last a little longer with 30...Kg8, but after 31.Rg3+, it's still a forced mate since the K must move back which allows 32.Qg7#.  It started off with an hour, but in the end no time remained.  Jack, who was enfuriated yelled and said, ""ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF WHY YOUR OPPONENT MADE THAT MOVE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT HE WANTS.  DON'T JUST ASSUME THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE, BUT ASK YOURSELF WHY HE PLAYED IT.""  That is an important lesson that GM Susan Polgar emphasized, and I have taught my students.  And, it seems so obvious, but it wasn't.  That's because right after my resignation, I had to get going, at once.  In other words, I had no more then 5 seconds to spare.  As noted, If time was on my side, I would've continued with 29...Rg8.  And, it would go as smoothly as it should be.  So, it's a good thing that it finished, as now, it's at least lost, instead of still in progress.  That's because if it doesn't finish, it remains that way as we don't resume.  Therefore, what there is to learn is actually what happened in the beginning where I blundered my piece, more then the threat that I would've seen with more time.  My take is that when a piece is threatened, you must ask yourself if they'll take with check or not.  Had I not been in check, my piece would've protected, as Tom would not have taken due to the Queen being in danger.  But, having gotten the check he had won a piece.

"He throws in the bishop sacrifice.
,I decide that rather than accept, I will grab a pawn on the other side of the board.

,Attacking e6 again.
,Of course, piece for pawn up, I offer a queen exchange.

,Gameknot prefers 27. Rb6 Qh8 28. Qg6+ Qg7 29. Qh5 and maybe a draw by repetition. I also wonder about the immediate 27. Re3 preparing Rg3
,I seek to remove his attacking knight for my defensive knight, but gameknot says it is yet another mistake and suggests  … Be7 28. Rb5 Bxg5 29. fxg5 Nc6 30. Rc5 Rc8 31. Rb1 Rc7 32. Rb6 Nxe5 33. Rxc7 Qxc7 34. Rxe6 Qf7 35. Qxf7+ Nxf7 36. Re7
,A good attacking move.
,So I remove the aggressive knight. OK, find black's best move here? 
,Did you find it? Instead of the automatic recapture many would make, white find a wonderful to keep his attack alive. I have to play really carefully over the next few moves.
,So my bishop comes back to prevent Rxg5
,But white pins the bishop, and threatens Rxe7 followed by Rxg5.
,So I break the pin. I did also consider Nf7 here, with the idea that after he takes my queen with check, I have rook, knight and bishop for the queen, but his rook is very active, for instance my a pawn is going. I think that would be very hard to win.

"So he avoid his knight exchange with bishop at h2 and also force my bishop at e5 to retreat.
,I thought this is best move in this situation.
,It seems to me another illogical move as it passivate LSB more at e2 than active at d3.
,This is also a bad exchange for me as it exchange a active bishop with a rather passive knight but i want to doubled white c pawn
,He take back
,Chess-dotcom given it an inaccuracy with slight advantage of 0.40 in favor of white but it seems me a one of best move since it add extra defender in d5 and f5 pawn also clear c7 path as i was determine to make c7-c5 in next move. 
,he take the central position but chess-dotcom prefer Bb2
,And this is why computer predict Nd4 is an inaccuracy. I forced knight to treat.

,So i try to exchange his active bishop with my Knight
,He avoid this exchange and gone to a much safer and active place at g2 as it now start defending h3 also
,So i attack his c3 pawn and at the same time block His LSB path. Although chessdotcom again give it and inaccuracy and suggest Qd6 is a better move 
,Force to take
,I take back with f pawn and clear f- file for rook movement
,Surprisingly chessdotcom suggest it a best move but for me it seems illogical to hide bishop and a wastage of time....
,Mistake ??? as Chess-dotcom analysis suggest. Chessdotcom suggest a better move was Qe8

"Just like with Tom Levine, this is how Stanley opens, as I've studied in some of his games with Jack.  Of course, he I stick with my usual.
,Not surprisingly, he plays the QG, which as usual, I'm going to decline using the Slav Defense.
,This is a very common reply.  And, of course, I also stick to the mainline by continuing with my development.
,I was not surprised to see this played.  As Stanley seeks to exchange.  Since I am not ready for that now, I stop it by cramming my other N.  But, I know that I can replace it later, as I learned from GM Susan Polgar and Ken.
,I am surprised to see this played.  I thought that white plays this move in response to the Colle's Franketort System or the London System.
,Therefore, I decide to copy white seeing that Stanley did it for a pawn chain.  I had no idea what to do and wasn't willing to spend more time trying to figure it out.  As this move makes me feel comfortable since I also have a pawn chain.  On top of which, I can continue developing and later castle.
,Meanwhile, Stanley continues with his development.
,As do I with this pin as the top thing on my mind.
,Not surprisingly, Stanley breaks it.  I had a hard choice to make.  I normally don't want to exchange here because of Ken's advice.
,?! But, this time, however, I don't hesitate to do it.  What's more is that aside from maybe from one move, nothing else came into consideration.  The reason is that he has doubled pawns.  But, this is an inaccuracy as my assessment.  I remember that Ken said it was also worth exchanging when you double up the opponents the pawn around the K.  That's what where I thought it was.  However, that, I believe was ghost vision.  As yes, he has doubled pawns, but it's no of major asset since it's around the Q side, instead.  And, I also overlooked that my Nf6 is still pinned.  With those two things, the timing wasn't right which means that my judgement still needs fixing.  That's because once he takes back, Stanley will have better mobility with the center as he is breaking through which is something that one does not want to see. 
,? I was just focused on castling.  And, for a few seconds, at most, I also considered 8...dxc4.  But, that's moving too quickly right there.  I didn't play it because I was worried about an exchange which wouldn't have benefited me.  What I overlooked is where his N is located.  Somehow, I thought it was on d2 or on e3 which is more likely.  I forgot that it's in a place that taking would've won a pawn.  Had I spent a little more time, I would've seen this, and thus, taken on c4.  I think that getting too excited made me think like Turtose, as opposed to, the Hair, as I've mentioned.  In doing so, Stanley will get the favorable exchange.
,As now, not only does Stanley continue developing, but as noted his mobility is better because his Bd3 is free to move about, whereas, my Bc8 is not.
,So, as noted, I repost my Knight.
,I am not sure why Stanley played this.  As right now, there isn't a semi open file his Rh1 is blocked, anyhow, lest he castles.
,So, I go on the attack by striking at his center.
,As anticipated, Stanley castles.
,And, I complete my development. 
,And, Stanley strikes at my center.
,So, I try to break the pin with this attack. 
,As anticipated, it doesn't phase Stanley.

"So, I start off with my usual.
,Since he knows my style of play, I am not surprised to see this played.  And, in fact, we stick with the mainlines until the fifth move.
,But, this is where it differs since 5...a6 is generally played.  
,With that I considered, 6.Bb5+ but don't know what that would accomplish after 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7 since one of those was his suggestion in Wizard Chess which I annotated.  And, I say that because of what happened against the computer where I played the Sicilian, but after 2...d6, 3.Bb5+ was immediately played, and I had a hard time knowing what to do to get out of check.  But, ION knew which means that he'd have a very good answer were I to do that to him.  Therefore, bearing that the d pawn is gone, this was played to connect my c and e pawns, as well as continuing the development to bring me one step closer to castling.
,And, ION responds by completing his fianchetto.  But, it gets interesting here as both of us castle.
,I also considered 8.Bg5, but it's not pinned.  More importantly, though, is that I'm thinking along a long plan.  And, that's the potential for my e4 pawn to become a passer which is why I decided to centralize my Rook.  Might not happen, but what if this worked?  Then, I'd have a Rook behind a passed pawn which is very useful in the endgame, and that is what I'm picturing here.
,Meanwhile, ION continues developing by attacking my N.
,So, I defend.
,And, ION plays the same move that's normally played on the fifth move of the Sicilian.  It didn't transpose, but I still put it under a very similar category because it's, as though, we were in a transposition since at a later time, black often fianchettos the DSB, right before completing the fianchetto with ...Bg7 which is also what happened here.
,Meanwhile, I complete my development, at once, as does ION.
,Not knowing what else to do, I decide to connect my Rooks, as per Ken's suggestion in a different game, when I made another unwise choice to exchange for the same reason.  And, he suggested bringing the Rooks together.
,I guess this was played to put pressure on my Nc3.
,Starting to feel it, I pull back, with the idea of bringing my N to a stronger square.  By that, I'm alluding to 13.Nf4
,But, nothing stops ION from connecting his pawns.
,ION is trying to win a pawn.
,But, with the opportunity, I decided to exchange right here.  And, the reason being was to mess up his pawn structures near the King because of what I learned from GM Susan Polgar.  And, in fact, Ken mentioned something similar in a couple of my annotations.  So, I felt that exchanging was wise here.
,? But, I overlooked what's coming here.  Yes, I followed Ken's suggestion about mobility, but I went overboard here as my assessment was wrong, in this position.  Since I overlooked that my b2 pawn is still hanging, and not to the Queen, in which, there might be a way to trap it.  Best would've been 15.Rab1, but this move loses a pawn.
,Given that my Rook was also en-prise, I decided to protect by centralizing it and hoping that, by doing it, the center is under complete control.  By, my assessment it is, because my Q and LSB are also in the center.
,I am not why this was played.
,But, nothing stops me from attacking the N.

In that game, I had rook, knight and two pawns for the queen, and, on an open board, the queen was slightly better. In this game, I also have to give up my queen - but my two rooks are far better than the queen on the closed board.
,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence
,The most common move.
,My usual, although 2....d6 is more popular, normally leading to the Najdorf_Variation or the Dragon_Variation
,Rossolimo Variation - a well-respected alternative to 3.d4. It is named after Nicolas Rossolimo and is related to the Moscow Variation. White's usual intention is to play Bxc6, giving Black doubled pawns. Black's major responses are 3...g6 preparing ...Bg7, 3...d6 preparing ...Bd7 (a hybrid line that also arises from the Moscow Variation after 2...d6 3.Bb5+ Nc6), and 3...e6 preparing 4...Nge7. Sergei Rublevsky and Tomáš Oral both play this line as well as the Moscow Variation.
,This is my usual reply, although g6 is more common.
,The usual move.
,In this way I prevent him from doubling my c pawns.
,Thematic - preparing to play d2-d4 with a good strong pawn centre.
,So I attack his bishop.
,He takes.
,I take back.
,He gets his centre.
,But I don't give him too much of a free hand there.
,The position is a little like an advanced French here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence#Advance_Variation:_3.e5
But compared to the Advanced variation of the French Defence, white's bishop has been exchanged for a black knight, so black is slightly less cramped. Having said that, in a blocked position like this, the knight is better than the bishop. Chances are about equal
,So I develop.
,So does he.
,I protect my c pawn as in Semenova, Lidia K (2271) vs. Kernazhitsky, Leonid (2355) which ended in a draw. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x1306386&fb=1&mv=18&rnd=0.27965961272303885
,He deviates from that game, and I am thinking for myself!
,The logical move.

"Allows me to centralize a knight, make space for my LSB to get into the game, and gets me closer to finishing my development.  While I could have moved my b pawn to allow my LSB out, I don't want to give up the angle for my queen to attack the king by blocking the b6 square.
,Generally speaking you don't want to let enemy pieces stick around on your side of the board, so pushing me away makes sense, but, it allows me to force his queen to move again.
,I'm not entirely certain what White is going for here... Perhaps some trade options for pawns or a chance to tackle my b pawn once I move out my bishop?
,There are a lot of places that White can move his queen that will cause him some serious trouble.  
,Tactical redeploy.  Might have been better to move there or to c2 originally.
,Now, finally getting my pincer attack in place for White's king.
,Trying to build some pressure and getting his DSB into the game.  Good positional play.
,I thought f4 could have held some tactical intrigue.  Another move worth considering is Kh1 to get the pin undone on the knight.  Instead this move allows Black to get a free pawn, isolate a center pawn, and still keep some attack options open.  Therefore I label this move a mistake.
,Natural follow up, forcing only one response from White.
,I elected to finalize my development and connect my rooks on the back rank.  In retrospect Re6 or Re2 could have been more fun.
,Mistake!  Other than Qxb7 I don't know what White was hoping to get out of this play, as he desperately needed that queen where it was to prevent any mischief against his king.
,Forcing a rook for knight trade.
,Blunder Mate (3).  In all my games this one is actually my first ever smother mate that I can recall achieving.
,White only made 3 real mistakes in the game, but rather than focus on the specific moves, I'll offer some advice.  I think what was lacking was any urgency to fully develop his pieces.  Instead of focusing on the white pawn that was effectively dead, White should have worked to finalize development sooner.  White moved his queen into Black territory twice, without a clear strategy and the second time it should have been maintaining defense.  When making forays into enemy territory, seek to use multiple pieces to have a sustained presence and threat.  Finally, you have to play defensively sometimes.  Don't move out pieces that are critical to defense and consider all potential moves on enemy attacks and understand when you have to trade, even if it's not to your advantage. Being ahead in points doesn't matter if you get checkmated.

Thanks for your comments and review.

,Protecting the a pawn. Fritz actually prefers 14......Bg4 here.
,White continues to attack, threatening to take twice on c6 and if 15....Bd7 then he can take on c6 followed by a7. The problem with this move is that white's queen-side is completely undeveloped, and hard to develop. His developed pieces are all over on the queen-side, leaving the king only protected by pawns. After a think, Fritz's evaluation of this position gradually gives black a bigger and bigger advantage - over plus 7 eventually! OK, so, given those clues, what would you play as black?
,Fritz also gives Ng4 as a good alternative.
,As good as anything. What would you play now?
,The best move, stopping white from playing 17. Nxe4 as Qe1+ is mating.
,Again the best defence. What would you play now?
,Developing with tempo, black maintains his advantage.
,And now?
,Did you find this? White picks up a bishop.
,Forced. Ok, take with bishop or queen, or play something else?
,This is best. No need to exchange our active queen for his passive queen.
,This is forced, otherwise white loses his queen immediately, or falls for a back-rank mate.
,This is good - Fritz evaluates this position as plus 8.59 - but Fritz thinks that Bh6 is even better - plus 9.24
What is black threatening now?

"Rather an arcane opening, this, but that's not really the point of this posting 

,Some of you will discern a similarity with patterns associated with Alekhine's defence; White's big centre, and the Black king's knight way over on b6. 
,Why did Black develop his knight just to have it driven back home? Clearly he hoped that inducing the d-pawn forward would be worth the two tempi expended to do so. 

,Take a look at this. This hasn't to do with the 'pattern' I mentioned earlier - that will appear soon - but to examine a most peculiar position. Black seems to have lost a heck of a lot of time, and is like to lose more. But what had White achieved in the meantime? Not a whole heck of a lot: an aggressive stance, but no real threats. 
,Black doesn't want to lose more time! 
,! Now, although this again isn't the topic of this posting. take a note of this move. This capture wins a rook. Taking with pawn instead would just be silly, achieving nothing. The Black a8-rook can not be defended, but if 14...Rxa7, 15.bxa7 and the pawn will promote. I have had this very motif crop up once in one of my own games. But here, Black has a counter-attack of his own, something very familiar to us...... 
,! And now, White dare not try 14.Ke2 on account of 14...Qf2ch 15.Kd3 Nd7! 16.Rxa8 Ne5ch 17.Kd4 e2#! So White played... 
,There you see it. A strange setting for this attack by Black - especially in view of 15 moves having been played, and both sides having one wing undeveloped. 
,The dear old knight pin pattern... 
,So Black doesn't lose a whole rook after all. I'll append the rest of the game without much further comment. 
,Not 18...Bxh1 19.Qxe5 Bxe5 20.bxc7 wins. 

,?!
,?
,!
,Unconcerned about the knight. 
,The Queen is a goner (familiar mating pattern of back rank mate with rook defended by the bishop - here the Black e-pawn supplies the bock to the f2-square), so White gathers what small change he can for it. 

,! Stronger than the immediate R-B fork by 25...Qd6, as this will pick up a pawn as well. 

,Black can't save the e-pawn in the long run, but can make its capture fraught with danger. 
,! Black dare not take the e-pawn on account of this well-known mating pattern: 34.Rxe2 Qf3ch 35.Kh4 g5ch [A] 36.Kxg5 Qf6ch 37.Kh5 Qh6#, or [B] 36.Kh5 Qf6 and Black has no defence.

"Instead of exchanging, White counter-attacks, and suddenly my early advantage seems to be withering away, a frequent experience against this opponent.
,I have to block the check and Queen threat, and if White snaps up my b-pawn then 19...Nxc4 wins my pawn back.
,Instead he retreats. Curiously, the analysis suggests giving up a further pawn with 9. c6 bxc6 20. Qe5 Qe7 21. Nf3 Rh7, keeping the pressure on.
,I get greedy. I know this is going to allow 20.e5 but I decide I'll worry about that if White plays it.
,He does, and now I worry.
,This only puts off the problem for one move.
,Now I'm in a dilemma. Trying to save the Knight with something like 21...Ne4 in the hope of counterplay is fraught with danger, since I've only just spotted that the Queen is threatening my undefended Rook, the result of my failing to castle. I have to give up the Knight!
,The analysis prefers castling K-side, but that side is so open now I've advanced my pawns I don't fancy it.
,This seemed like a move to save me, especially if I can follow up with 23...Ne4, threatening mate. the fact that it happens is due only to my opponent missing the option to force a Queen exchange with 23.Qd4. It's true I get to win the pawn on f6, but it's never going to Queen and the resulting position after 23. Qd4 Qxd4 24. Rxd4 Rhf8 25. Nf3 Rxf6 26. O-O Re8 probably favours White. It must do; the computer says so.
,This is really disastrous. That pawn is going nowhere, and White needed to look to his defence.
,I get to threaten mate as planned. But 23...Ba4 was more dangerous...24. Rd5 Rhf8 25. Qd4 Rxd5 26. Qxe3 fxe3 27. Nf3 Rxf7 puts me well ahead. As it is, I think I have a mating  attack, but it's only in my head.
,Clearly my opponent thought, and I did, that the Rook had to move to give the King an escape square, and where better to go than to attack the Queen, even if it allows 24...Qf2+ But the only escape was 24. Qd4 Nf2 25. Qxe3 fxe3 26. Rc1 Bc6 27. Ba6 Kb8 28. Bb5 Nxh1 29. Bxc6 bxc6 30. Rxc6 Rhf8 31. Rxc7 and I'm still winning, but haven't won. As it is, mate is forced.
,White could have prolonged the game by interposing his Queen.
,But it's mate next move and he resigned. An attack that gave me a kind of spurious satisfaction, in that it only worked because my opponent missed key defensive moves. But it was played quickly in an hour or so!

"I have limited experience of playing against Bird's opening; on previous occasions I have played positionally with 1...d5 , Nf6 e6 , but I read recently that this gambit can (sometimes) pose problems for white! 
,Trying the line I read about. However, I was discouraged to discover that my opponent had programmed in conditional moves up to and including move 8! 
,The queen is being a nuisance. The rook on h8 is now under attack. Would you castle here? 
,An awkward check to face. The queen is nicely centralised and exerts strong pressure against b7, hence why I cannot block this check comfortably.
,Seemed the only move.
,White is trying to dominate the h1-a8 diagonal, which would potentially freeze my Queenside development. He is a pawn up, although none of his minor pieces are developed, and the queen has already moved 4 times. For these reasons I embarked upon a strategy of reckless aggression!
,The attacking potential of my queen and bishop is the justification for this quick pawn advance. 
,Could have taken on g3 but first I preferred to limit the bishop and to keep the tension near his king.
,An important move. Defends my king and prevents d4. The white queen does a good job of preventing my Queenside development, however the bishop on c8 is actually fairly active, and it defends b7.
,This move undefends g3.
,With my king on g7 I can afford a zwischenzug here to suddenly emerge a pawn up with a dangerous attack.
,Qf2 followed by Nh4 is a strong idea. White prevents this.
,The g2 bishop is currently the only piece defending the king. It cannot move due to Qf1#, so it will be exchanged. With the white king trapped in the corner I had the idea of taking on g2 and getting a deadly fianchettod on b7. My opponent responded combatively to this idea.
,I thought Nc3 was better, as this allows me to execute my plan.
,Another important move, I thought. It prevented white from any c5 ideas himself, and it prepares b6 next. With a knight on c3 instead, my move would have weakened d5 perhaps a bit too much. 
,Good move. White has counterplay with Qc6 and my open king. For example Bb7 now would spoil my attack after Qd7+. 
,Still trying to play Bb7! 
,This is a losing blunder, but I did not see it. 25...Qxf1 wins immediately, but I went blindly into something messy and murky!
,Hitting the rook. Now my opponent played a shocking move.
,!! I dealt with this beautiful move poorly, but on further analysis it appears that Rf7 loses for white.

,I started with e4 not something I like to go with.  I sometimes think maybe my opponent has a lot of knowledge and can use this to gain advantage so I try to go with something different.  My opponent went with e6 nothing too aggressive.
,I developed my knight to c3 protecting my pawn at e4.
,Black went with d7 to d5 and can capture my pawn.
,I now go with d4 stopping black going d5 to d4. and attacking my knight.
,Black develops his knight to f6 and could capture my e4 pawn and protects his d5 pawn.
,I decide to go with Bd3 protecting my e4 pawn.
,Black develops his DB to e7.   Black has the queen at d8 and the DB at e7 ready to attack down the diagonal to h4.  Once the f6 knight moves these pieces can use their fire power.
,I decide to block the center with e4 to e5.  I am attacking the f6 knight.
,So black moves his knight to e4 and is able to capture my knight on c3.  I do have my LB at d3 but I am reluctant to capture since it would be recaptured by pawn at d5.
,I could have captured the knight at e4 with my c3 knight but instead I moved pawn to a3.  This was done to stop black pinning my knight with his bishop.  I did not think about black moving his DB to h4 and attacking my pawn at f2 which was already attacked by black's e4 knight. I could have developed my knight to f3 which might have been the best move by me to avoid black using the h4 square to attack my king.
,So my knight was captured by black's e4 knight and I recaptured with my b2 pawn.  I now have doubled pawns on the c file and the b file is open.
,Black now castled.
,I now developed my knight to f3 and can also castle.
,Black also developed his knight to c6.  Black seems to have almost completed his opening with the development of the knight but is looking quite squashed and only really has access down the d8 to h4 diagonal.  White has the centre controlled at present. 
,White now castles.
,Black moves pawn to a6 to stop my LB moving to b5 and pinning his knight at c6.
,I now develop my final piece, my DB, to f4 which provides protection to the e4 pawn again since the f3 knight is already protecting this.
,Black moves f7 to f5 which will allow his LB to access the a8 diagonal as well as the c8 diagonal.
,I move my queen to e2 and the rooks are now connected.  There is one weak pawn at c3 but my emphasis is going to be on attacking black's king from the king side.

"out of an Italian setup the Two Knights Defense, also one of my all time favorites to battle against... always very sharp play...
,an often recommended sideline, which is as good as refuted...
,the Blackburne Variation, with after cxb5?, Qxa8; this variation is largely responsible for the extinction of this system with Na5... in stead, modern theory continues with Nxd5, d4, Be7, Nxf7 (Fischers' recommendation) or Nxd5, Qh5, g6, Qf3... my personal favorite is Nxd5, Nxf7, Kxf7, Qf3+, Ke6, Nc3, with all kinds of complications...
,I prefer this over the Steinitz move Be2, also recommended by Kasparov; too intricate play for me... trick here is, both players lose tempo, but white gains more back... Na5 is clearly displaced...
,probably better Nd5 at this stage, and maybe even Nf4 or Nb4 after that to exchange Bd3 while we still can......
,unclear what made black do this... best is Nc6, Nd5, Qd6, Nxf6+, Qxf6...
,also here, Nc6 was to be prefered; black is entering a whole new world of pain...
,it took me too long to figure out if Nd5, Qd7, f4 (or Nxe7+, Qxe7,f4) was stronger... so straight away f4; exf4 is of course met with Bxf4......
,I liked this better than releasing the tension with fxe5...
,and the bluff worked; black had better in to move on with Qd7, since e5 is lost in all variations after fxe5, Nxe5, Bf4, f6, Rae1... after Qd7 however white gets to play f5, with possible mayhem on f6... Qd6 holds the crosspin over e5 intact...
,the right time to take on e5: Nxe5 is met with Bf4, f6, Rae1...
,the only way to go, for both black and white... (note: here, I meant to have played Rae1)
,I would have chosen Rad8, c4, Qd7... black is locking in Rf8 now... this might open possibilities... (note: here, I meant he played Rfe8; even stating, he was locking in Rf8; very strange what happened here)
,first of all, cxb4? leads to serious problems after d4... and after bxc5, Qxc5+, d4!, f5, dxc5, fxe4, we have a good way to swap Queens... we need some leverage on f6-f5, so we drive the black Queen out of the way from Ne5...
,white holds on to bxc5 just a little bit longer... in fact forcing black, to take on b4; else maybe b5...
,up until now, there was not much wrong with whites' play; after Qxe5, fxe5, bxc5, white is clearly better... but something went very wrong during move 21...
,for some reason, in whites' mind, his annotations and analysis, he had played and annotated 21. Rae1, and black had played Rfe8; as we can see, that clearly was not the case... whatever happened, in whites' perception, notations, demonstration board and all, Ra1 was in fact on f1, and Rf8 in fact on a8... a very rare case of chess blindness, where the mind prevails over game reality; wishfull thinking? we might never know... in short: with no rook on f1, and a rook on f8, Nxf6+, is nothing less than a losing blunder... Qxf6 was not possible with a rook on f1, and after gxf6 white is winning... now, white might be losing...
,these are the breaks...
,Qxe8, Rxe8, Rxe8+, Kh7, can never solve this... we need the Queen...

"And, I resigned here because I am gonna have to give up a Rook to avoid mate without anything else in return.  As, the only option is 33...Rf7, and after Tom takes, I've got nothing else to fight for or learn from.  In the end, Jack, my opponent, and I analyzed this position.  According Jack, there was nothing that black could have done to prevent this, as white had an overwhelming attack and took advantage of it.  But, I know that he is wrong here because if I had played 31...a3! white would not have been able to break through.  And, after coming down, 32...Rf7 would've, at the least, been able to hold a draw.  As Tom would not have been able to break through.  Once he did, white had an overwhelming amount of attacking forces against my K for black to stand a chance.

"! - A useful intermezzo.  Even if unessential, one should not pass up a tempo if it will help the cause.  This check means that even after the removal of the Black pawn, there will still be an obstacle to a straight run by White's a-pawn.  Black will have gained an extra move to round up the g-pawn.  (Ironically, later on Black 'has' to play a waiting move - a tempo-losing move - but 'time' is one of the three elements of chess: material, space and time).
,Any K-move to the 4th rank would have done.
,Aiming for b7, combined with the advance of the a-pawn.  Had Black time to snaffle the g-pawn and then to reel in the a-pawn?  Let's see, shall we?
,Just two moves and White will have his drawing position of K on b7 and P on a6.  Black has, before the pawn can move to a7, to get his knight SAFELY onto one of the squares b5, c6 or c8.  How will he achieve that?  
,During the game, I thought 84...Ne6 would have been a mistake, but in fact it is just as effective as the text.  The aim here is ...Nd6, whence he can choose from the 2 squares b5 and c8 according to which is available.
,Edges closer, whilst the knight is being held off by the King.  No use would have been 85...Kb7 as 86.Nd6ch immediately brought the pawn to book.
,! - 
,? - Better was Kd7 or Kd5.  White has to be careful himself, here, as he doesn't want his king to be cornered with no escape.  Once it becomes clear that Black can stop and win the pawn without the loss of a piece, White could at once take his chances in the infamous king-bishop-knight vs king end game.  Though it is a winning endgame, it is not so easy.  I have had such endings before - three times, and won all three.  But they were all pick-up games, and from positions a deal more favourable to me than would probably have obtained in this game.  At this point I was certain we were in for my second ever 100-mover, stretching maybe into 120 moves or more.  For the first 100-mover check out: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/great-snakes-batman-a-100-mover?gm=18341

,After this, Black can not cover both b5 and c8.
,? - Now was White's last chance to prolong the game...
,Blockade complete.  But it is worse than that.  Suddenly White's King can no longer escape into mid-board.  It turns out that White had to play 88.a7 to keep some chance, however slender, of saving the game.  Would I have won the K-B-N vs K end game?  I'm about 75% sure I would have, but that leaves plenty of room for doubt.
,How to round up the enemy King.  Box him in and and tighten the screws.  But be sure to leave him with at least ONE square to move to, until you are ready to deliver the KO.
,There is always the hope I might get careless and play ...Kc7?? Stalemate.
,At this point, White had realised the writing was on the wall and resigned.  The game wasn't going to reach 100 moves, neither - I think he might have played it out otherwise.  It is a forced mate in 6 more moves, which I'll set down as though they were played.
,A waiting move.  Equally effective would have been ...Bf2 and ...Bg1, or even ...Bc5.  Not ...Bb6, though.  There, it would get in the way.
,Not 94.a7 Nb6ch 95.Kb8 Be5#
,And not 95.a7 this time, neither, as at once would then come 95.Be5#.
,Leaving Black with but one move...
,One of those game that I was lucky to win, with nothing much in it - maybe a slight edge for White - for 35 moves, and even when the balance tipped Black's way, it was not easy to see a way to win, even when Black gained a passed pawn of his own.  It wasn't until it became clear that White would have to give up a rook to prevent the Black h-pawn's promotion that Black's winning prospects looked realistic.

"And, not surprisingly, ION defends.
,So, I attack it again.
,And, ION defends again.
,Given that the attack failed, which I figured it would, I bring my N back to where it was originally since it was a little cramped on d7.
,ION, however, has other ideas since it appears that his goal is to attack it.  So, I bring it back to d7 where that won't happen.  As attacking it appears that attacking it would also give white a better pawn structure being the threat of a pawn chain.
,This is where he is able to repose his N.  Not sure, I ask myself what to do.
,But, nothing else came into consideration, as I figured that the best approach was to centralize one of my Rooks since that is generally the way to go.
,Other moves, however, should've been considered as ION is now breaking through one of those pawns.  At first, I thought nothing of this because defending it would potentially expose the K since preventing this move would mean having had played 15...h5 or 15...f5.  And, I don't like to break open the K, unless it's the endgame.  But, I think it was necessary, in this position.
,Trying to see what I can still do to stop, I use my center pawn.
,But, ION has an answer to that.
,Not knowing where to go about, I bring my N back to where it was originally was.  As I am now comfortable that ION has no intention of attacking it.  So, the idea was attacking the pawn, in case, he had plans to break through.  I forgot, however, that the N could still be attacked, but if he did that, however, I'd threaten an exchange with 18...Ng4.
,Not chancing it, this is how ION defends his pawn.
,Seeing that he could now attack it again, I bring my N back, again.
,Which allows him to break through.  At first, I wasn't afraid since instead of exchanging, I advance the pawn up.
,? But, this is my first mistake because what I didn't realize is that ION is going to win a pawn.  And, when I try to get it back...
,?? ION wins a piece, as I forgot that my Nd7 was en-prise.  Better would've been 20...Nf8, but after 21.gxh7+ Nxh7 or 21...Kxh7 22.gxf6 ION is still a pawn up.  That's because 22...Bxf6?? will also lose a piece because of his Rf1.  But, with 20...hxg6 I am almost ready to resign, and it is, indeed, a resignable position.
,As now, I am down another pawn and for the same reason.
,Therefore, given that my B is attacked, I retreat to prevent the passed pawn from promoting.
,But, after this check, however, I resign.  My only options are 23...Kh8, or 23...Kh7.  ION has a better position.  Against someone of mine, or even Jack Stockel's strength, I would've continued.  Similar to reversion's open fire, and my games against reversion, the reason I joined this tournament was to learn.  But, there is nothing else to learn here.  And, it's against much stronger opposition.  So, felt that resignation was the best response as playing on would be no way to learn.  In addition, while it's blocked for now, I know that sooner or later, ION will find a way to promote his f6 because I studied a similar example with Coach Stockel.  And, combine his Be6 and Rf1 is more of an example.  Overall, I am happy with this game and feel that I've played better then other games against this opponent.  But, it was the mistake or two that I made, in the end, that did me in.

"This was a very lucky win for me, as my opponent missed a complicated winning combination at the end. This game didn't have very auspicious start for me. I was late. I couldn't find the venue, even though I had played there before. It was about 8 pm when I arrived. I hoped to be able to rattle through a few moves of theory without really thinking, but my opponent had played 1. b4, the Polish (Sokolsky) opening (A00) - also known as the Orangutan Opening - a complete surprise, and I had to start thinking for myself right from the start. Not what I wanted!
,I remember in the Sixth form of King's School, Chester, Martin Lee telling me that 1....c6 refutes 1. b4 and showing me the line 1. b4 c6 2. Bb2 Qb6 3. a3 a5 but I am not convinced that it is best for black to neglect development like that. I follow another path - what I found out later to be the most common reply.
Martin sadly died at a young age. http://www.hackneychess.org.uk/node/538
,He attacks my pawn.
,I defend it.
,He decides to sacrifice his d pawn, for the sake of quick development.
,So I take.
,He develops, threatening to regain the pawn by taking the knight with his bishop on g8 and then playing Qh5+ after my rook recapture.
,So this seemed the best way to stopping that.
,He plays the check anyway.
,I block with my knight.
,Normal development - but at this stage I was frightened of him playing Nf3-h4 next move.
,This looks most odd, but I wanted to break the pin for the reasons given above. Almost as soon as I had played it I saw that Nc6 was better, preparing Nc-e7 to back up my Ng6. Interestingly Fritz also likes a king move, but likes Kf8 instead. No human player playing black has moved the king at this stage - it looks madness to give up castling rights like this - but perhaps it is not so bad. You will see shortly why I decided to move my king to e7 rather than f8.
,He obviously hadn't expected the king move, and at least it had the benefit of slowing him down. Up to now he had been moving virtually instantly. After his think, he just calmly castled, planning to open up the centre and get at my king.
,But I have plans too, one of which is Be6 to blunt his Bc4, which is why I played my king to e7 not f8.
,So this is part of his plan to open up the centre.
,I carry on with my plan. Fritz prefers Qe8.
,He develops, protecting his Bc4. Stop - find black's next move.
,Did you see it? part of a combination of moves to pick up a second pawn.
,So the queen drops back, pinning my f pawn.
,This is part of my plan, although Fritz likes 10....g7-g5 instead, and if 11. Qh6 then 11....Qf8. Although it looks crazy to throw forward king-side pawns like that, but this variation does seem to force the queens off, leaving me a pawn up, so it probably was better than what I played.

"Donald Byrne (1930–1976) was one of the leading American chess masters at the time of this game. He won the 1953 U.S. Open Championship, and later represented the United States in the 1962, 1964, and 1968 Chess Olympiads. He became an International Master in 1962, and probably would have risen further if not for ill health. Robert ""Bobby"" Fischer (1943–2008) was at this time a promising young master. Following this game, he had a meteoric rise, winning the 1957 U.S. Open on tiebreaks, winning the 1957–58 U.S. (Closed) Championship (and all seven later championships in which he played), qualifying for the Candidates Tournament and becoming in 1958 the world's youngest grandmaster at the age of 15. He won the world championship in 1972, and is considered by many to be the greatest chess player of all time...
,In this game, Fischer demonstrates noteworthy innovation and improvisation. Byrne, after a standard opening, makes a seemingly minor mistake on move 11, losing a tempo by moving the same piece twice. Fischer pounces with brilliant sacrificial play, culminating in a queen sacrifice on move 17. Byrne captures the queen, but Fischer gets far too much material for it – a rook, two bishops, and a pawn. At the end, Fischer's pieces coordinate to force checkmate, while Byrne's queen sits, useless, on the other side of the board...

,after a rather peculiar opening sequence, we reached some breed of the Grünfeld Defense; White controls much of the center, but Black has already castled... after e4, d6 (Black needs to prepare c5), Be2, White has solid play...
,daring but not too solid; better d6, e4, Nbd7, Be2, c5, d5, Ng4...
,there is no doubt, that e3, dxc4 (c6, Qb3), Bxc4, Nbd7, Ne5 would have been much safer...
,no use, is the so-called Prins Variation Na6; e3, c5, dxc5, Qa5, Be5!...
,also here, e3 would have been much sounder play; after Qb6, Be2, Be6, Qd3, all is well... also Qb3, Nbd7 e3, poses no problems...
,b5, Qb3, Qa5, Bd3, leads nowhere soon; Qb6 might disrupt Whites' play, after Be2, Qxb2, Rb1, Qa3, 0-0, Qa5...
,also here Be2 was to be much preferred; after Nb6, Qb3...
,not safe at all; best is Qb3, Be6, Qc2, Bg4, Be2...
,just playing the best moves; after this Be2, Nfd7, Qg5, Bxf3, Bxf3, e5, and we trade Queens...
,but this is taking too much out of Whites' defenses; absolutely necessary was Be2...
,this move - which is not bad at all, is dubbed ""One of the most powerful moves of all time.""  Fischer offers an ingenious knight sacrifice. If Byrne played Nxa4, Fischer would reply Nxe4, leaving Byrne with some terrible choices... 
,or Qb4, Nxc3, bxc3, Nxe4, Bxe7, a5! (Qb6 is better for White), Qa3, Qd7, Bxf8, Bxf8...
,at this point, Bxf8, Bxf8, Qb3, Nxc3, Qxb6, axb6, Ra1/Rd2, was still worth considering... but now, Fischer is unleashed and pushes another sacrifice...
,no good either is Qxc3, Rfe8, 0-0, Rxe7, Rde1, Rae8, Ne5, Be6...
,this must certainly be the move, that made this game famous; a Queen sacrifice upon two earlier sacrifices... the best way out of this is Qxc3, Qxc5, dxc5, Bxc3, Bxe6, Rxe6; Byrne decides to take the Queen, much to his dismay...
,Blacks' pieces are working nicely together in this stunning windmill variation... White is left without a chance...
,no use either is Qxa4, Nxa4, h3, Bxa2, Kh2...
,slightly better is Qxb7, Bd5, Re1...

,Quite a fight for the initiative is going on.  Had White played 41.Rd3, then 41...Bd6 42.Rh3 Kg7! looks OK for Black.
,Or else 43,Rf6 Nd4ch  44.Kf2 Be7  45.Rh6 Nf5  46.Rc6 Bc4ch 47.Kf1 (or Ke1; Bb4ch) Bd6.  To break the rook out of c6 would have required White to sac a pawn: c4-c5. 
,Probably better than 45.Re6 Ne7.  But maybe 45.Rd5!? would have been worth a look: 45...Rxd5 (worth it to break off a pawn from the Q-side 'island') 46.cxd5 Ne7 47.Ke2, and Black would have to think twice about 47...Nxd5 48.Rf3 and suddenly White's two passers are mobile again.
,With a vague threat of ...Rb2 and ...Nd4 to attack the b-pawn.  
,Sensible,  Defends against the threat and also frees the king from the back rank.  
,Still wants to keep his rook on.  Black values his flexibility to continue probes and threats that force White to respond.
,Don't sell easily parried short ranged threats below their value, just because they are short ranged and easily parried.  They are often a means to an end.  The threat now is ...Rxf4ch.  Black definitely has the initiative for the moment, but can he keep it?
,By covering squares on the e-file, this frees the minor pieces to move.
,!? - A wrong turning.  This leads nowhere.
,Fortunately, I was able to rewind, here.  White dare not exchange rooks right now owing to the knight fork (Rxd4?? Nxd4ch)
,Threatens ...Nd4ch.  For the moment, progress for both sides has stalled.  It was beginning to look as though I would have to try my chances after all with the exchange of rooks.
,Heading back to f5 whilst the 'heading back' is good.

,Forces the rook exchange, and just at the right moment, too. If now 54.Rxd6 Bxd6 attacks f- and h-pawns both: 54.Rh1 Bxf5 and White can not play 55.Rf1 on account of 55...Ne3ch.
,! Now if Black exchanges, the White king is handily placed near the centre.
,But there was nothing to stop this.  After the win of the pawn Black at last has a passed pawn of his own to play with.  Possibly White might, somewhere during the sequel, have considered a plan to give up his two pawns on the K-side for Black's h-pawn.  Then with the pawns equal on the Q-side defied Black to make good his material advantage.  I spent a lot of time studying such endings that might have arisen, with the conclusion that, with care, White might well have held.
,Instead, 55.Re5  Rxd3  56.Kxd3 Bd6 57.Re4 Nf5.
,Rightly centralising the King.  The f-pawn is safe...
,! - In my view the alternative, 57...Ng7 is less pressurising, though it has its points: 58.Ke4 Ne6  59.g6ch Kf6!  60.Rg2 h4  61.Rg4! h3!  62.g7 Nxg7  63.Rh4 Ne6  64.Rxh3 Nxg4.  Could Black have won from here, with B and N vs R and pawns level and symmetrical?  I thought the chances problematical, and elected to try something a bit more forcing.
,Now comes some intricate manoeuvring as Black forces his way into White's territory.

"White doesn't like to exchange his dsb, but I do like the open column.

"Of course, 18.Ne5 is no longer playable.
,By moving the knight out and back again, White loses two tempi with Black reaping the benefit.  'Admitting a mistake' in this way shows flexibility of mind, and, every now and then one has no alternative.  But it is far more often better to look for some way to extract value, even from a poor move.  As it happens, 18.Nf4 was not so bad a move at all.  White could now have played 19.Ne6, forcing the exchange of knights on e6 on account of the Q-R fork.  Play might have gone 19.Ne6 Nxe6  20.Bxe6 Re5 21.Bxf7ch!? ... (Possibly unnecessary) 21...Rxf7 22.Qxa4.  Balanced against White's extra two pawns would be Black's more active game, so the outcome would be uncertain!

,I do recommend that, if you can see no reason NOT to take 'free' material, then take it.  But here the reason not to take it is immediate; another 'one-mover'.  Actually, on this occasion, once again it is more complicated than that.  But the real point is that White overlooked the double-attack - the pawn fork - in Black's reply.
,Bang!  It so happens that White had a tactical means of getting out of this fork.  Complicating things, though, is the frenetic activity of Black's pieces, which renders even the escape problematic.
,?  This shows that White didn't 'see' 20....b5 in response to her taking the a-pawn.  Whenever you have two pieces a square apart in an advanced position you have to keep an eye out for pawn forks...  Any 'fork' really, as any piece can 'fork' such a pair, even a rook.   Instead, 21.Bxf7ch R8xf7  22.Qd1 ... is the immediate save, but then comes 22...Nf3ch! 23.gxf3 Qxd34 24.f4	Rxf4  with a powerful attack.  The GK engine gives 25.f3 Bc5+ 26.Kh1 Rxf3 27.Rxf3  Rxf3 28.Qb3+ Qxb3 29.axb3  Kf7 30.Kg2 Rxb3 31.Ra8 - an ending only a pawn down, but with an incarcerated bishop.  So even though the outlook would not have been promising after 21.Bxf7ch, it offered better prospects than this Queen move! 
,White HAD to recapture the pawn: 22.Qxc4.
,! Excellent play, bringing just about every Black piece into the action.    The attack that followed led to Black delivering mate on move 30.  Here it is without further comment.
,?? 
,?! Overlooking mates in 6 or 7 moves in this and the next turn is really neither here nor there at this level.  The moves Black played were good enough to win comfortably.  You can win a game only once... 
,A piece sacrifice! Well played, even if not the best.
,! 
,Even after 30.Rg1. Black had a forced mate in 3.

"not much options left; the White King needs assistance...
,the point of no return...
,not better is g4, fxg4, hxg4, e4, and soon f3...
,one defender of a1 down...
,no hesitation; we need to keep the White Bishops out of play... also preparing f4; the Black King is guarding Whites' h-pawns via Ke6-Kf7-Kg6... soon, White has to cope with another set of freepawns, and will lose material...
,a bit better is Bf1, Ne5, h5, Nf3+, Kf2...
,no mercy...
,to avoid f3, no doubt; a bit better was h5, f3, Bf1, e3, Bd3...
,ready for e3 and an eventual Be4; Bb2 has to stay on guard against Blacks' a-pawn... now, Blacks' new set of free pawns will decide...
,practically forced... after Bf3!, Bxc2 (Bxf3??, h7), Kg2, Ne5, Bd5, Bh7, White is in even more trouble...
,a bad mistake; White had to play Bc1, Kd6, Kf1, Bxc2, Ke2 (better than h4, Bh7, Ke2), to keep the e-pawn under control while guarding a3... this way, the White Bishop of the black squares will get more squares than he can handle...
,too late for Bc1, after a3, Bxa3, f3, soon followed by f2...
,all the same: Bxa3, f3...
,what else?
,relentless... now after f3, the e-pawn becomes lethal after e2; but also f2+ is losing, due to promotion on f1 after Bd3... and after Bxe3, of course promotion on a1... this game is not far from over for White...
,in my opinion stronger than Bd3+, Kg2, Be4+, Kg1, f3, or even Kd5, Bc3, f3, etc., because Bxe3 is practically forced... Gameknot's computer analysis however, considered this a blunder: better is Kd5, Bc3, f3, Kg1, f2+, Kg2, Be4+, Kg3, f1Q, Kg4, e2, c6, Qf3+, Kg5, Qxc3, Kg4, a1Q, c7, e1Q; all forced... Black sports a staggering three Queens, and mate follows on move 78; not very surprising... apart from the fact, the actual game variation reaches mate quicker, there is indeed a better way; after Kg4 (better Kh4, e2, Kg4, to win a - useless - tempo), Qf5+, Kh4, e2, Kg3, a1Q, Bxa1, e1B+ (why not a bishop?), Kh2, Qf2, mate is reached 1 move sooner, same as in the actual game...
,no fussing about, we need to be careful to avoid stalemate; this is the fastest way to mate, after h4, Qg2+, Ke1, Qe2#...
,or Kf4, with the same result...
,no mercy...
,forced, or else f1Q, and sooner mate; unsportsmanlike as it may seem...

"I decided to play slow I guess lol
,My B will be happy here.
,=
,?!  The computer begs for this move a few tempo ago but now it's too late.
,I'm aiming at 7 central squares vs his 3.  So let's open up his k-side.......
,If he replies dxe5 I get active with the obvious 17.Qxh5 +/- or even 17.Bxe5
,Computer says -/+ worse than 2 pawns behind.
,A distraction.
,Computer suggests 19...g4 and that certainly would have been annoying.  20.Qh5 is already showing up in the computer.  Later on I see it.
,?  I moved my K to h2 knowing that ...Bxh3 was annoying but I got blind to the result of .gxh3 Rxf3 and how the g-pawn protector of the f3 N is gone.  Thankfully he missed it too.
,Computer considers this bad.  Probably should have maintained pressure on K-side I guess.  Anyway it's annoying counterplay.  Also computer wanted me to reply 23.b4 or d4.
,I'm starting to see his open K-side so let's counter attack.  Do or die time!!
,Computer says I'm almost back to even as of a few moves ago.  I foiled his threat and built my own attack with initiative.  But the text move is wimpy, slow and clunky.  Qe3 or even Bd1 would have been better.
,??  30...Bxg3 will still work.  Computer says 31.e5 (don't get it) Qxc2 32.Qxg3 Rxg3+ 33.Kxg3 Kh7 34.Rg1 Qxb2 chasing me around with checks and captures.  But he missed it too lol.
,Sets up possible e5 with discovered attack on his Q
,Wasn't sure about this move.  It's pointless when you've already got a k-side attack and initiative is so important.  Anyway, computer doesn't like it but he played in to it so he was obviously distracted by it.  Mission accomplished.
,!  Sets up a possible fork on g5.  In hind-sight I should have taken his N sooner.
,Not dxe5 because 38...Ng5+!! is an obvious fork but also initiates a discovered attack on my Q if I reply with the natural fxg5.  Also watch that his h-pawn is doing absolutely nothing.
,?  Takes his Q out of action.  Computer says clear advantage white and he never recovers.
,Analyze this.  Trying to smother his K but the simple pawn advance would have been quicker and still keep that R so inaccurate.  But he makes a few mistakes and I capitalize.  He who makes the last mistake loses lol.  The position begged for certain tactics that reminded me of those puzzles that I loath.  But I guess they pay off.

"Like me, this is how Tom opens up, as well.
,And, I answer with my usual, as well.
,After taking note of what Tom did against my 1...c5 this is his most usual response.  Still shows how intense openings can be since I'm not so used to it.
,Therefore, I continue with my usual.
,Continuing with his development.
,As do I with this pin.
,Not surprisingly, Tom breaks it.
,To prevent, 5.Nb5, I play the typical move in the Sicilian, despite it being the closed variation.
,Getting a pawn chain, but I don't like this move because this makes his Be2 much less mobile.
,Feeling like in a somewhat better position, I continue developing.
,As does Tom.  But, treating this a little bit like the Spanish Opening since I'm out of familar territory, I decide to kick his Bishop in an attempt to gain tempo.  But, it's not the best choice, as Tom will get a favorable exchange.  My goal was not to exchange, but rather make him retreat, but I didn't analyze what happened afterwards.  The reason being is, of course, being yelled at by Jack but for a good reason of moving too quickly in the last game.
,As I overlooked this.  I thought that taking lost a piece which is why I take back.  Might as well to avoid losing a pawn.  However, without giving any thought, I just figured that his Be2 will become a menace.  Therefore, unlike with other games, the only thing that came into consideration was getting rid of it, so I exchange on e2, first.  Maybe not a great choice because if you're to look from a different angle, my Bg4 was certainly more mobile then his Be2.  So, exchanging there wasn't the best choice.  Instead, better was to reduce it and just exchange on e5.  Once again, I didn't give it any thought as I'm still overwhelmed with what happened before.  And, it is an example of a bad moment getting the best of me.  This will continue, and things will only go downhill, as we're bound to see.
,Not wanting to further exchange, I retreat.  
,But, with the B attacked, Tom protects.
,And, I continue developing.
,So, Tom threatens to exchange.
,And, this was played with the idea of tricking Tom into a pin.  It works because of what he does next.
,After which, I use the opportunity to castle.  But, better was 12...Bf6 because with two attackers against the N, now exchanging would benefit black as Tom would be faced with doubled pawns around the K.  In return, he's also left with isolated pawns.  As GM Susan Polgar pointed in the Polgar University 2017 this would not be a way good way to go about.  You don't want doubled pawns around the K where it's vulnerable to exposure, and you especially don't want your pawns isolated.  This is refereed to as a destroyed pawn structure.
,Tom sees that I have missed that opportunity and castles, instead.
,So, I calmly continue developing, instead.  I'm also getting ready to attack his Queen, as well.

"And, Kannie does the same thing.
,I don't see the point behind this move.  This appears to weaken the King.  That's why I would not have considered this move.  Instead, I would've fianchetto'd the undeveloped B with 12...b6 to allow 13...Bb7 followed by 14...Rad8 or 14...Rae8 with the idea of centralizing a R.  That would have been the plan.  
,I also don't why Kanie retreated, given that his B was not attacked.
,Unlike before, I do see the point.  But, I would have held off until white Nf3 has moved.  The plan is 14...Qh6, followed by 15...g4, as that forces white to lose a piece to prevent a checkmate on h2.
,But, Kanie puts a stop to that by opening up a window for his monarch.
,So, getoverit comes up with a different plan being a pawn storm.
,I don't know why Kanie played this.  Instead, I would've centralized with 15.Rad1.
,But, I do see the logic is.  The plan behind this move is to expose white's King.  I saw the same thing unfold in Charleshiggie's mini tournament between him and brigadecommander.  And, this is how Charles defeated Janet.  And, I annotated that game a while back.
,However, Kanie has plans of his own.
,I would've captured with 16...hxg3 because if white plays 17.hxg3, black go on a K side assault with 17...Qh6.
,Avoiding an exchange, getoverit moves his N.  And, this is exactly what I would've also played.  However, Kanie is still going to exchange the other N.  Personally, I don't see how this benefits him since that's what he wants.  But, I can't find anything else for white, though.
,Kanie still wants the exchange.
,But, this is where getoverit really goes on the offense.  I am very familiar with this pattern even though the Q isn't there.  However, my being familiar makes me realize that despite material being even, black has an advantage.  And, it's not hard to believe because fiercequeen told me that it's not mostly about who's ahead or not material wise.  It's instead, about who has a space advantage or extra tempo.  In this context, getoverit has the space advantage.
,Kanie centralizes his R, but that doesn't change what I said before as I still favor getoverit's position.
,And, this is what I was talking about with the B landing on h3.  Usually the Q hit's this area first, but doing it later doesn't change anything.  It shows that Kanie's K side is somewhat weak.
,Mu guess is that Kanie is trying to strengthen it.
,But, getoverit just adds to the attack.
,I am not sure why Kanie played this because he isn't going to double on the d file with his other R.  In my opinion, this is where white really starts getting in trouble.  It turns out that what I was worried about happens on getoverit's next move.  And, as noted, charleshiggie won against brigadecommander in a very similar way.
,I was expecting something like 24...Qh7.  But, this is even more powerful.
,getoverit is planning to do something with that R.  I'm just not sure what because he doesn't play 26...Rh7 which is what I anticipate.

"I start off with my usual.
,As does Tom.  Of course, this is going to become the Spanish Opening.  Just like with fiercequeen, this is my favorite as white.
,Instead of retreating, I decided to exchange right away.  And, it wasn't just because I could exchange.  I like to hold off.  But, had I retreated with 4.Ba4 then would come something like 4...b5 5.Bb3, and after 5...Na5, I'm forced to exchange.  I'd rather exchange now then at that point.  That's because unlike the doubled pawns that Tom will wind up with, I don't want to allow doubled pawns on my side along the b file.  As that would be of an asset.  And, I didn't want to play 4.Bd3 as that blocks my center pawn.  In fact, I told my student, reachforgoals that it's not a good idea.  However, there's one move that I failed to consider.  So, instead of exchanging, I think that best would've been 4.Be2  As I also considered Bc4 and asked myself what would happen is Tom attacks 4...c6.  4.Bf1 also came into consideration, but I didn't want to undevelop my LSB which would make it difficult to castle.  So, had I given it a little more thought, 4.Be2 is what I would've played, instead.
,Because Tom did not play the Berlin Defense, I, for the first time in a while, thought about tipsyjouneyman told me in the Ruy Lopez.  So, I decided to hold off on castling for one move by developing another piece.  This is a transposition of what I had considered and what's normally done.  As I usually play 5.0-0, followed by 6.Nc3, in this position.  But, the reverse happened here.
,Protecting his e5 pawn.  But, I was not about to take it because he would be able to answer with 5...Qe7 winning it back.  Afterwhich, despite it being even, black would have an advantage, as I learned from Coach Stockel.  That's similar to what you see in the Berlin Defense, after 4.0-0 Nxe5 5.Re1 which white wins back the pawn and gets the advantage, so it's the same idea.  
,As noted, this is what I had in mind after 5.Nc3 since this is a transposition of my general play here.
,Completing his development.
,I was very tempted to play 7.d4 but wanted to avoid falling into the Noah's Ark Trap.
,Meanwhile, Tom continues with his development.
,And, I pin that N.
,I had expected 8...Be7 as that's how I normally answer and would do it, were I playing as black.  But, Tom broke the pin this way.
,Since I didn't feel a need, I refrain from exchanging.  Afterall, I'm keeping in mind the dream that I had and what GM Susan Polgar mentioned about when to exchange.  Now, if Tom was forced to recapture with the K, it would be a whole different story as we'd be talking about his K side pawn structure, but that's not the case here.  So, there would not be an immediate advantage to playing 9.Bxf6, instead.
,I don't see the point behind this move.  Mate is not threatened here.  Now, his Queen was on h4, and my N was not on f3, it would be a different story.  As 10.h3 would be forced.  But, I have nothing to worry about, in this position.  Thus, I ask the important of what Tom wants?  Sure enough, it's to exchange on e3.
,For the same reason that I noted with the pin, I refuse, just as Kenneth_fiore_3 refused to exchange in our first game and won that way.  It was after declining combined with the coaching why Tom wanted it.  He had to have felt pressure, and thus, exchanging would relieve that.  But, as Ken said during that game, ""The pressure stays on.""
,?? Thinking that this would take it away and, assuming there was Ghost Vision, he assumed that this would take care of the problem.  He probably thought that this was a piece here, with which, it's an even exchange.  But, he took a pawn.  So, by doing this, I am going to win the N, in return.
,Trying to mobilize his R.  It was more limited before, but now, it can move an extra square.  So, it's a semi open file.
,I ignore and try to put a bit of pressure against his K.  I start analyzing a line which I thought might be effective until later on.  But, it continues even with my next move.  I am, however, having a small amount of Tunnel Vision, but it's not quite enough to effect my play.
,The whole idea behind this move, and 12.Qf3 was because it looked like white was threatening a checkmate.  But, that's where I figured out that it was Tunnel Vision because of where the N is now placed, in contrast to, where I thought it was placed.  So, hyperfocus right on the f7 square which is why it's Tunnel Vision.  As I thought that I might have a mating sequence.  This would, however, be true if the N were on g5, and he didn't have the pan h6.  So, in disguise, it was a good thing that this Tunnel Vision was there, as otherwise, he might have compensated, and even wound up the equivalent to a pawn up as this would have been a free N.  
,Feeling some pressure and trying to compensate, Tom attacks b2.
,And, I defend.

"In response to my promotion, Jack tries to take advantage with his promotion, as well as, the check.
,But, it's too little too late.
,Without many other options, besides pinning and winning my Ng4 he takes my Rook instead.
,But, I've got a mating attack starting with this move.
,And, after this move, I mate him, at once.  However, if Jack had played 59...Ka6, I would've mated, starting with 60.Qa8+  The next few moves are forced which would lead to mate.  An, example would be 60...Kb6.  So after 61.Qa7 Kc6, I'd mate with 62.Qc7#  And, if Jack interposes with 59...Rc7, my next move would be 60.Qxc7+.  That gives Jack only two options of either 60...Ka6 or 60...Ka8, but the next move would be the same.  And, that is 61.Qb7# which is also mate.  Therefore, black would get mated in all variations.
,After this game, Jack told me what happened.  First, instead of 54...Rf3+, we looked at what would happen if he forked before I promoted, so 54...Kc6  Black, however, would still be busted because of my a4 pawn since there is no way out of mate as he said.  For example, 55.d7 Kxd5 56.d8=Q+ Kc6 57.Qd7+ Kc5 58.Rb5#   But, as I thought that he made lucky blunders that allowed me to pull a swindle and win.  However, Jack said that the blunders that he made were not luck.  Instead, he allowed me to win because of my readiness to resign.  What he's emphasizing is something similar to what I see in TA's blitz Q sacs which is another reason I like studying them.  That is, don't resign so quickly, even if, you are at a disadvantage.  For, you don't know when you're opponent will go wrong.  I partially agree with him, especially with players at or below my rating.  But, I have doubts with players a lot stronger because ION, Ken, and reversion have all said that one should resign after getting a piece or higher, or when you feel that there is nothing left to learn.  That's what I thought against Jack, but he showed me otherwise which is why he has let his opponents win before.  However, another way of looking at it is not to trust your opponent.  So, one must decide whether to agree or not.  Normally, I would not and think of it as luck.  But, I don't here because after 47.f4, black did not capture with 47...exf4+  Had he done that, after 48.Kxf4, black is still winning and for the same reason being that my dangerous pawn is gone.  And, that would, in return, take away the opportunity to get back in the game.  And, after 49.fxe5, combined with the checks, he did not take back with ...dxe5.  Yes, I'd still get a pawn back but would, in return, lose the passed pawn which was used to promote and win the game.  So, him not taking back and allowing me to promote is what made me realize that there was no luck here.  And, that's because, in general, Mr. Stockel does not miss moves like that.  Therefore, the moral of this story is to not resign just because you feel that there is nothing left to learn.  Instead, keep playing, and only resign when the position hopeless against a stronger player.  So, as a new guideline I'll thinking of some of them similar to the Supplemental Talking the Talk (original WTW rules).  And, those rules state that one is not allowed to resign until a mate is proven.  That is, until the runner has a forced mating sequence.

"At first, I overlooked this and attacked his Queen with 17...Rad8 which is the same mistake a student made against me.  And, with it, the mentoring started.  Jack: Is 17...Rad1 a good move?  Joe: I didn't know what the Queen wanted.  Oh, you're trying to mate me.  Jack: How many times must I tell you to look at your King first?
,He continued here by saying, ""You must always look at your King first.  Not just once, but all of the time.""  Now comes an interesting threat, which I overlooked. 
,?? As this is where I thought that it was safe to attack the Queen with the idea of defending but inaccurately.  He was trying to get my B, but I thought it was safe here.  My thought was that if he is to take, I'll recapture.  So, I didn't trust, and was thus, sure that he wasn't going to grab my Bishop.  But, similar to what we've seen in other games, I became overly confident.  That's because I overlooked, that I'll be in check once he takes which will leave me a piece down.
,He checks again, and it gets interesting.
,?? This loses right away.  Nothing else should've come into consideration, aside from 20...gxh5.  The reason for not playing that is because I thought that 21.Qxh7+ is mate as I told Jack when he asked.  But, it is not.  By playing this, however, Jack now has a mate in two.  
,With that being said, I resigned here because after 21...Kh5 which if forced, 22.Qg5# is mate.   After the game, we reviewed that and he asked me why I didn't take his Nh5 with 20...gxh5.  When I told him the reason, he said that, in the future, I'm gonna need to study the position a little bit more, just like in our first game.  The solution here is also taking a little longer to look at the position.  But, you will be shocked at what else develops.  So, capturing would've helped, but the positon was still lost for black due to my Queen being out of play.  That's when I remember to be a spectator of my own game, based on if I agree or see something different.  I usually agree, but in this case, I see something different.  With that, I don't completely agree with his assessment.  As I believe that 20...Kh6?? was the losing blunder, in it of itself.  For had I taken back, and Jack had taken back, I have made up for lost material and would have plenty to fight for.  Not only that, but his attacking forces against my King would not have been as strong.  So, there would've been a chance for me to get a draw.  But, by moving the monarch the way I did, black was busted because of what happened afterwards.  After this game, Jack went back to making a mistake, in which I got a piece, but moved a little quickly.  Then, I messed up in the endgame since I had to leave.  In doing so, it ended in a draw.  The moral of this story is what Jack and I discussed in the Men's Room while saying goodbye.  So, on top of taking enough time, he said that one the things that must come into consideration is the K.  And, that I need to watch out for it's safety.   I agree with him there since K safety is very important, as Jack Stockel has previously emphasized with this being the perfect example.

"It was hard to know and how much participation we were going to get.  But, Mikko decided on 1.d4  It's a common move.
,And, I stick with what I know.
,ynwa77: E3, then c4?  Anyone?  knightrider62: C4 straight away e3 blocks the bishop in.  easy-win: My vote is for knight d2  ynwa77: Why Nd2? That sounds interesting.  easy-win: Nd2
Is actually the prelude to an opening I am quite familiar with. 

However the preceding moves must be precise, due to the 
nature of the opening. Any variation will absolutely diminish 
the possibility of success.  ynwa77: Then I also vote Nd2  knightrider62: I will join you Nd2 sounds intriguing  I made my move Nd2.
,I played this.  Although not a KID.  I am used to the variations which involves a very early fianchetto by black.  I'm not used to seeing 2.Nd2 being played, and as we know, openings can be very intense.  So, the idea is to adjust to what you're not used to by accepting it for what it is, just like how it is in Yoga.  That's why I expect the unexpected.
,easy-win: Vote 3.f4 A move that needs to be supported eventually but not immediately  ynwa77: I'm happy to stealth's idea. I want to see how this opening works.  knightrider62: Will follow stealth, likewise f4  ynwa77: I made the move.
,Of course, my idea of a good time is being able to complete fianchetto.  I enjoy having the longest diagonal for, at least, one of my Bishops.  In addition, I do have a threat against their d4 pawn.
,ynwa77: I vote b3 or e3.  knightrider62: My vote is b3  easy-win:  I concur 4.b3
Time to protect the pawns in front.  ynwa77: B3 it is then.
,And, this was played to win the pawn that I mentioned on my last move.
,ynwa77: I can think only Rb1. We still gonna lose our change to castle but at least rook is safe. 
Any other thoughts?  easy-win: 5.Rb1
Of course, what I cannot understand is why you suggested 
b3 to begin with. 
In doing that you went off the stonewall opening, and offered 
that free pawn on d4. 

Also, you did not give enough time for others to offer suggestions, 
and thus allow for us to change our vote, if we were confused with 
the move b3. 

I thought you had some devious plan by suggesting that move, 
but now I see that there was no logical thought behind it. 

If we are to win this game, please give others and myself plenty 
of time to reconsider, in case of a typo, or some other reason.  ynwa77: I apologise. It was my fault. In future please notice, that I'll only make my suggest and if I have plan I will share it with you. 
I want to be positive. We will not be down in material and if we have to change wN to bB, our position is not too bad. Of course it would be nice to have castle, but we can manage without it. 

My intention is never hurry other players. You can take all the time you want. We need to just learn how we each other think and things will get smoother. 

I want to think I made my blunder now and I make better moves later. 

And if you two think it is better to sacrifice R and keep castle still available, it's fine to me.  And I know this is just trying to explain things better, but we will have f,g and h pawns free to move them forward and that way we can make position unorthodox and unfamiliar for jkarp. 
But that is something we need to talk later  ynwa77: And of course there is still c3 available if we want to go pawn down but keep queen side castle open.  knightrider62: Rb1 is the only move.  penguin_: Late entry I agree with Rb1  ynwa77: I will move Rb1 
,ynwa77: Basic rules for this kind of game
Shall we have open discussion of this game or do we just talk about next move and why it is done? 
I think it would benefit us all if we can toss ideas and possible future moves and positions even if opponent can see it.  penguin_: I agree the major objective in these type of games is to learn winning is secondary.  knightrider62: Nd-f3 bringing the knight to a better square and attacking the bishop twice.  easy-win: Nd-f3 is not recommended by instructors
The point being is that if you move the same piece twice in the opening 
you lose tempo since you could move another piece for advantage, 
in this case, the knight on g 1 has not been moved and will serve the 
same purpose as moving that d knight. 
Also, it makes more room for castling on the king side, if that is what we 
need to do later. 
In the opening, it is always good to place your pieces in such a way that 
they will have more control like future attacks, and to defend if possible. 

Also we should place the number in front of the suggested move, so we 
can keep track of the number of moves we have made, and when to make 
the next move. 

In this case, it is premature to suggest a move before the opponent moves 
so that we can know what would be the best move after that move is made.
 ?! On a separate note: This was played to develop my N and prepare to castle.  But, better was 5...Bc3 to pin the N right away.  Once pinned, it would be difficult for them to break it.  I can only hope that white does not move their Nd2.  If they do, this opportunity is gone.  
,easy-win: Vote Ng-f3
In making this move, we are controlling the way the 
opponent moves, by attacking. 
The opponent will either move the DS bishop, or might 
want to protect the it with a pawn or a knight. 

It is always good to try to figure out what we think 
the opponent will react to what we do. 
If we can accurately figure that out, we have an 
advantage. But in order to do this, we have to 
consider the response/s as close as possible, 
which is not simple, especially when the opponent 
has a much higher rating than we have.  knightrider62: Ok I agree as it has the same purpose as my suggested move nf3 it is.  ynwa77: Do we have plan if black moves next Bc5 or Bb6? Because if we miss next move it is going to be Ng4.  I think we should also consider h3. If we have to exchange N to B, we have strong B. 
Just thinking possibilities.  easy-win: The question is if Bc5 or Bb6
We need to keep developing, but let us wait what our opponent does first. 

On that move of h3, again we have to wait for a move, to counter the move. 

The blunder b3 has put us at a disadvantage which will be like waiting for a wound to heal  ynwa77: So is right way to play Ng-f3 and then, if black makes Bc5 or Bb6, h3?  easy-win: I think for now that is the best we can do, but let's see if anyone else 
can make a better suggestion. 

On h3 the knight can capture that pawn. 

B-b5 or c5 and we should fianchetto out BSB. 

Still we should wait for others. 

By the way, how many are participating in the group?  penguin_: h3 White has gotten itself into a bit of a hole, however it can recover. I vote h3 to keep the B and N away.  easy-win: Votes
Stealth-invader 6.Ng-f3 
knight rider 6.Ng-f3 
penguin 6.h3 

flatus77: not yet but to answer the question, h3, after Ng-f6, yes.  ynwa77: I prefer h3 first, but I can live with Ng-f6' then h3 if necessary too. I don't see any instant danger there.  penguin_: Take a look if Black plays Ng4 followed by Ne3. See what you think?  ynwa77: Ou! 
I saw only fork Nf2, not Ne3. So I vote H3.  knightrider62: I change my vote to h3 for the above reason
,penguin_: Question ?
So who is playing for black?  knightrider62: Joe Karp is.  It was his idea.  jkarp: Yes, I am black.  penguin_: OK I am with it now.  Be it note that, for the most part, I wasn't reading their posts.  But, as I was about to post this move with the fen this question came out.  Whenever something like that happens, I clarify it to avoid confusion.  On a seperate note, as implied, after I forgot about the opportunity, when playing 5...Nf6 I could've pinned at once.  I was just hoping that the opportunity wasn't gone.  But, with 6.h3 being played it was around, and I took advantage before that opportunity was gone.
,easy-win: Vote 7.Nf3 This move will connect the knights,  knightrider62: A very good idea, I agree  penguin_: Bb2
I would like to see us play Bb2 and force blacks play with his B. Otherwise he may advance to Ne4 and then to Nf2.  easy-win:  If we move our bishop to b2
Then white will trade bishops in all likelihood, 
Since we are already at a disadvantage by 
losing our b pawn without compensation 
I believe what we should strive for is to 
maintain a positional balance until we 
can find a point in the game when we 
might be able to find it possible to 
gain an advantage.  ynwa77: E3
If we move Bb2, then black d4 and he still control tempo. With e3 we can next move Ne2 and give pressure to black's B. 

Or we can after e3 move Bb5+ and if black c6 we then Nf2 and I think we have better position. 

I'm not sure about this, but like to get your comments.  knightrider62: I still like Nf3 it is a developing move we need right now  I mean the N on g1  penguin_: Ngf3
I will go along with Ngf3  ynwa77: Correction
I meant e3, then Ne2, not Nf2. Sorry. 
I still think that is best option. I think trading our N to blacks B would benefit us.  easy-win: votes

,Just before making this move, there was some questions.  As it took me a while to make moves.  In fact, I postponed my games.  And, with the question came clarification.  knightrider62: What is happening about this game?  jkarp: Up until today, it was white's turn. But, now it is black's turn, Sue. I am going to take some time, but it is worth noting that what delayed this game was my decision to postpone. The final decision came as a result of the Blizzard which wasn't as bad. But, even without, I was considering postponing, anyway, because of how busy it got. It was mainly work related, but there were other things to. What's important to note is that this is why the game took a pause.  When I said as bad, I meant as bad as I thought.  What happened is that a Blizzard Warning was issued for my area.  And, the forecast called for 18-24 inches of snow with 50+ mph winds.  Power outage was a potential.  However, the wind wasn't as bad, and sleet mixed in.  Thus, all in all, I got about a foot of snow, and no power was loss.  Yet, a lot was going on, and postponing, by my books, was the right call.  On a separate note: The idea behind this move is that I am now threatening to win another pawn.
,easy-win: vote 8.e3 pawn f4 is attacked by the queen  knightrider62: I agree with you stealth.  penguin_: I agree e3 is the correct move  ynwa77: What do we do next if black Ne4? I see there only instant problems. If we have counter for that move, I agree e3  easy-win: ynw
Ne4 does not present a serious problem that I am able to discern. 
Among other moves which can be made next is the possible Bb5+. 
I have found that extensive analysis into the possibilities that exist, 
are only as effective as the analyzer. 
For this reason, we have several opinions from which to decide 
on each move. At the present position, if anyone can identify a 
danger on the suggested move, I ask that it can be discussed 
before we decide to proceed. 

ynwa77, could you expound on the detrimental positional disadvantage 
that you find in the suggested move, e3?  ynwa77: Stealth, I trust your analysis
I am concerned the fact that black is connecting his pieces and is locking our pieces. I also don't like the idea that black is dictating tempo and therefore would like to try Ne5, then exchange bishops and attack to Q with both Ns. 
I don't have clear plan, so I don't want to ruin everybodys game because my gutfeeling. 

Here is way better players than me so I'm with e3.  easy-win: Not at all
I always welcome other options, and am always open to receive 
other views which may be refreshing, such as yours. 

Do not ever hold back on your opinions, maybe no one else might be 
able to see something you can see. 

In your suggestion of Ne5, neither one of our N's can move there, 
(to e5), and at this time, our pawn at f4 is in danger of being taken by 
the queen on the next move which will also enable it to move to 
g3, checkmate! 

However, you are correct in that black has the advantage. 

With e3 we may be able to free our WSB thus opening the back 
rank for king side castle. 

At present, our N's are connected, giving our king more security.  ynwa77: Why can't we move N from f3 to e5?  I withdraw my previous question As I see now that we will lose N that way.
,The logic behind pinning their Nd2 was to allow this move.  As now, I have a plan against them.
,knightrider62: We are in a bit of trouble due to that earlier move of b3. Looks like our only move is Bd3 . 1. Bd3 BxN+, 2. BxB NxN. 3.QxN. The exchanges are equal but black is a pawn up from earlier and I'm not sure who benefits from the trades.but at least we develop two pieces.  easy-win: VOTE 9.Bd3 The best move in my opinion. 
It develops our WSB and clears the f1 and g1. 

Knightrider62, It would be preferable if you could submit your vote with you explanation. 
Because this way we can accumulate the votes necessary for our next move.  ynwa77: Vote Bd3
It opens chance to castle. 
I like to think situation positionally, and that Bc3 is disturbing me way too much. It is something I need to work with inside my own head, but right now I'm just scared that B is getting as big trouble. As I said, it's just a feeling.  easy-win:  ynwa77
It is not good to worry. 
When we see a position where the opponent has placed a piece 
or pawn in a threatening square, what we should do is to check how 
many of our own pieces are defending, and if our defense is 
adequate, the next step is to see if it is possible for the opponent 
to bring additional pressure to the piece, and if so, is there a way 
to increase the defense, or parry with an attack of our own.. 
In the present diagram, our d2 knight is defended 4 times, 
the threat consists only of a knight, or knight bishop exchange 
because we have four defenders to the knight. 
The move that might force the bishop away could be B-b2 
if the bishop moves to the edge a file, then the rook falls. 

But for now, I believe Bd3 is a safe enough move that 
favors our development. 

But I am always open to suggestions and/or discussion. 

The bottom line is, not to worry, but to study the position 
and decide the best course to follow.  penguin_: Vote Bd3
Bd3 is the best we have at the moment. Then we may be able to castle and start to bring some pressure on black. White got into trouble early but we can recover.
,knightrider62: Newa to me it's the first I have heard of it.  easy-win: OKAY On with the game. 
We shall wait for Joe to make his move, the go from there.  Thanks to all, for being attentive of the game.  And, I have played as this was the plan behind 6...Bc3 followed by 8...Ne4  As now, white is forced to give up their right to castle.
,knightrider62: My vote castle I vote we castle out of this threat by black  easy-win: Vote 10.Rh2 knightrider62, it is not possible to castle, since the black knight 
controls a square the king must cross. 
Our Rook at h1 is being threatened by 
that knight, therefore it is imperative 
to move it away from h1.  ynwa77: Vote 10.Rh2 I agree Stealths point of view  penguin_: vote 10 Rh2
Sounds good to me 
,ynwa77: Suggestion
I think we should decide do we want to play this game orthodox or unorthodox way. 
Considering the situation and nature of this game, it might be good idea to try something we don't do in normal games. 
I still want to win this game and play as good as I can, but maybe we can expand our game a bit. 
For example in current position I normally wouldn't consider moving Kf2 but that's only because it looks risky. But is there some benefits in that move if we can use K active piece instead thinking it as something that must be just protected? 
Any thoughts anyone?   knightrider62: There are always exceptions to the rules. So it is the demands of the situation that we should meet. Not Wether it is orthodox or not. Trading a rook for a knight is not a. Good idea so cannot be considered as a worthy counter attack.  On a separate note: although white's opportunity to castle is gone, black's is not.  So, I took advantage of that opportunity while it was still there.  In addition, to avoid confusion, since I postponed, I notified everyone that I'm taking a break from my games. redfoxrising: Jkarp has paused Joe has a day vacation set, Now is a good time for white to discuss their next move.

"From the way I see it, though, it is too little and too late, especially since I'm now up the equivalent of a Rook with nothing in return.
,Doing what Tom can and hoping for a blunder, he played this.  Believe it or not, it is Hope Chess which almost worked.  And, that's where I still need to work on taking my time and not moving too fast.  
,As my original play was an oversight.  The move was 15.Re1??  Forgetting that my Bc1 was not developed the idea was centralizing my Rook, whilst attacking his Queen.  But, with my B locked in that hope almost worked, as now, he would've equalized.  This is important because unlike here, if this were still the tournament, that would've been the final move.  And, it's not because there's not much time.  Instead, it's that once you've made that move, even if you see that it's a mistake, there's no going back.  Thus, I would've lost all of my advantage.  I'm only lucky here that it's not.  So, I took that move right once before he captured, so it was just before I saw what he was about.  That's when Tom reminded me to take my time which is what also needs work during the tournament.  The other move that I considered was hitting the Queen by bringing my Bc1 into play.  Problem is that I can't since that is keeping my b2 pawn protected.  It's also worth noting that for the obvious reason fianchettoing would be just as bad as Re1??, so that was not considered.  Not knowing what else to do, I decided to play it safe and protect my LSB. 
,At first, I was surprised to see Tom play this.  But, I figured out why, and it turns out that this is a dangerous plan.  Again, it is Hope Chess as he's hoping that I would overlook the threat which would allow the threat, as afterall, I'm threatening to take on b6.
,But, remembering what happened in my rated game against bhidragon, I take it very seriously.  As I had considered 16.Qxb6??  However, this is another reminder of where timing is important.  In this case, it involves what bhidragon told me which is seeing the big picture.  Another way of saying it is seeing everything that's occurring on the board in order to figure out what the position demands.  The idea being is that Tom was threatening a checkmate on me.  So, if I had captured on f6, he would've played 16...Ng4  After which, there would have been no way to prevent 17...Qxh2#  Additionally, no good would've been attempting to prevent the same move with 18.h3??  As after 18...Qxh3 Tom has gotten back a pawn, and the threat is renewed in almost the same way that I saw with bhidragon.  Since after a blunder, he had a crushing attack which started with Qh3  And, I used that same strategy in two games afterwards, so I am familiar with the pattern.  Afterwards, I could still delay 19...Ng4 with this move, but after 19...Qxg3+ white is still busted in a winning position.  So, this move prevents that trouble, as Tom's N can't just come in.  With that being said, what I also remember was Jack's lecture on just how dangerous the N's can be.  Well, this is a perfect example.    
,With that being said, I guess that Tom is trying to hold off on the attack with this attack. 
,But, unlike before, with the threat gone, it was now safe to play this.
,Doing what Tom can, he attacks my Queen.  But, similar to what Ken said, nothing will stop me from taking on c5.
,With that being said, this is when I would resign.  As Tom is far behind without a chance of counterplay.  If it were stronger opposition, and not of equal strength, I'd probably resign right after losing the Rook.  But, this is further behind, and, therefore, there is nothing else to get from this game.  But, I guess that Tom doesn't feel this way.
,With that being said, Tom tries to get my Rook.  But, he overlooks that it was pinned to his Queen.  With that being said, I will allow him to take my Rook in exchange for his Q and N.  
,Not knowing what else to do, Tom advances his e pawn.  Maybe, he wants a passed pawn.
,But, I just take it.
,And, this check is of no concern to me.  Tom doesn't have his Queen or anything else that can make this check harmful.
,Tom must have been worried that I would play Qf6-g4 followed by Bh6 where mate would be threatened, especially given that he would not be able to play ...gxh6 since it's pinned.  I was thinking about that line but since it prevents it, and even before that, I was asking myself what to do.  First, it is possible for me to take on d4.  So, that is my next move.
,I think that Tom is worried about the same.  So, I decided to take his B, instead.
,Thinking about where to go I played.  I was even thinking about bringing my Bc1 into play.  But, I decided that it would not be necessary, as I have some dangerous passed pawn.  So, I decided to advance one of them.  I was then thinking that I would be, at some point, possible to bring my Bc1 into play.  And, even, Sacrifice my Queen for his Rook to promote.  As from there, it's a forced line.  So, I was thinking along these lines which involves several variations.  And, that's important to think about. 
,?? But, this move, however, makes it very easy for me.  And, it is a forced win at once.  If the Rook weren't emprise, I'd ask what you'd play as otherwise it's a lot harder.
,The idea is that even without mate, I was going to play this anyhow, as it wins a Rook at once.  In other words, there no need to promote or sac the Queen to do it.  However, I looked at it and it's even more then just winning the other rook which is also the reason behind it.  That's because I figured out that this is checkmate since Tom's back rank was unprotected.  I seized advantage of my opportunity and went for it.  It was an interesting game, but after Tom's double blunder early being a piece and then a Rook, I had the advantage and did not give it back.  In doing so, I was able to force the win.  But, what I learned here is that even with the win I still need to take my time.  That's because by moving too quickly, I almost gave up my advantage and allowed equalization being the general oversight where I almost blundered the R which would've happened in a tournament where there's no going back.  So, it is very important to be aware of that, as well as, remembering how important the timing is.  As the timing by one move made the difference between losing a pawn and getting a piece for pawn.  By holding off just one move, it worked out in my favor which is what allowed me to take advantage of the first blunder.

"Unlike the last two games, I am black this time around.  That's because Coach Stockel wanted to switch things up so that Carl would get used to playing with the white and black pieces.
,So, I stick with my usual.  The next few moves are all standard, as Jack explains to Carl.
,This is also common in the Sicilian.  But, I sense that white might have a threat with his LSB and N.  I realize that I was wrong, but in the game, I was in a hurry, in an attempt to get the game finished, which doesn't happen.  
,So, I just assumed that there was a threat, and treat, as though, white were attempting SM.  This isn't true, and players with experience don't.  This is one of them, but I treated it as though he did just to keep the game going.  I'm also am eying Carl's Nd4.
,To prevent any kind of nonsense, Jack has him retreat.
,Meanwhile, I continue with my development.
,This was played to prevent 8...Nb4.  What Jack didn't know, however, is that I was not going to play that, one or another.  As my primary focus is on development and castling.
,However, contrary to what I learned with Ken, this is a moment where I exchange just because it is possible to do so.  In other words, it's my readiness to do so.  And, although other things came into consideration, it's the time crunch.  For, had there been more time before noon (which is when I and others have to leave), I would've held off by developing my Bf8.  The problem is that with time being of the essence, my thought process is just absent.  As I didn't give this move a lot of thought, whatsoever.  Sure enough, my instinct about what's to come, as noted, is correct.  But, right now, white has an advantage.  For, the exchange means that I'm forced to double up my pawns.  And, I lose castling rights since 10.Qxd8+, with which, white is clearly better, despite it being even, material wise.
,That lose, also allows Carl to pin.
,But, I just break it, regardless with what Jack has told me is the best way.
,That allows Jack to castle.  And, this is where white's advantage starts to become noticeable.
,With that being said, I complete my development.  To be truthful, nothing else came into consideration because this was the quickest way to get my DSB into play.  What I don't like, however, is the pin that's about to come.
,The plan here is to make, as though, I had castled.  It just takes four moves, as opposed to, one.  It's bringing a Rook over, getting the K down, bringing the other R over, and then, bringing the K back which is how it works.
,The idea was to protect his LSB, as it was attacked.  But, if I were Jack, I'd have Carl play 14.Bb3 where it's also protected.  And, the B keeps the pawns more supported since it seems more passive.  Meanwhile, I continue my plan of getting the R's connected by breaking the pin, at once.  And, although white still has the advantage, I am, believe it or not, feeling more comfortable.  This time, it's not because of the position, but rather, I'm feeling comfortable that white won't be able to convert his advantage into a win because time is running out.  Let's see, we started off with 30 minutes, but now, there's only about 15 minutes left here.  And, I'm continue to make it difficult for white to keep his edge.
,This is Carl starts his plan of doubling up.  But, there's also pressure against my Bd7.
,With me being almost out of time, as well, I forgot that Bd7 was protected by my Nf6.  Figuring that it was attacked, I add another defender.
,But, this allows Carl to double up at once, after which, the pressure increases against me.
,So, I free it up by trying to put pressure on his e4 pawn.  I also had the exchange in mind.  As I didn't consider anything else due to not being able to double up, combined with being low on time.
,Which allows Carl to open up one of his pawns.
,So, I try to chase off white's Bg5.  I figured that it would work, but he exchanges.  And, believe it or not, right after we exchange, I feel happy and confident.  As right now, there is only 10 minutes left before we have to leave.

"Trying to win my Bishop.  But, this is where I lose it.  Part of it was me thinking about what happened in our first game and why Jack was being uptight about it.  Turns out that with what he showed, and what he explained while saying goodbye, and as per the chess diagram, he had good reason to get upset.
,?? By lose it, I meant that I didn't take enough time to see what was happening.  I figured that I just won tempo and possibly a pawn.  I figured that taking my Bishop would be a mistake because of the threat.  What I overlooked is that when he takes, I'm in check which is similar to what happened against tombulous in the loss with him where it was that one mistake that prevented a draw.  Best here was 14...Bg5.
,As now, Tom is bringing an attacker against my King.  So, I refrain from taking on c2 since there is a bigger danger.  I asked myself how to defend, and found a really good move that comes close to trapping his Queen.  So, I attack with my less active Nd7.
,And, I also go on the attack, myself in case Tom has similar future plans.
,As now, I take and am beginning to feel quite happy about my position, believe it or not.  Though, the problem is becoming too satisfied that I miss other things.
,So, Tom attacks my Rook.
,I considered exchanging with 20.Nxa1, but since I'm still behind, I didn't feel like liquidating.
,Not surprisingly, Tom defends by attacking my Queen.
,After defending, Tom attacks my R.
,So, I attack again by threatening a N fork.
,Which Tom defends.
,So, I centralize my other Rook and plan to attack his d3 pawn.
,And, Tom counterattacks.
,As do I.
,And, Tom attacks.
,So, I go back to plan A and allow him to exchange.  What I forgot is that I'm now forced take back with the pawn which will ruin my pawn structures.
,At first, I didn't know why this was played, but this is the start to Tom's basic but ugly threat.
,Therefore, I plan to Tom's Queen.  However, this is where we start running low on time because I have to leave in like 10 or 15 minutes.
,Trying to activate Rook which works.
,Not being able to spend too much time but also interested in getting the Rook, this was played very quickly.  Better, however, 27...f5, as now, Tom is forced to retreat.  And, after that discovered attack, I can reconnect my doubled pawns with 28...fxe4  From there, it would be, more or less, even.

"Which he protects.
,So, I plan to attack his Rook.
,But, after this move, I realized that it wouldn't work, which is why he played this.  As after 18.Na7 Ra8, my N is trapped.  And, that would force me to liquidate N's which I don't want to do since I'm behind.  Therefore, I decide to bring it back to where it was developed keeping in mind now that he can't advance his pawn to a4 due to the R moving.  And, even if it hadn't, there would be interference since his Rook would be blocked by blacks Ba6.
,I know that an exchange is forced.  But, I ask myself what to exchange.  In the end, I decide to trade off B's.  As now, I have a small amount of hope of counterplay since Charles can no longer castle.  Actually he can but can't avoid the loss of tempo if he recaptures with 19...Nxf8.
,And, in doing so, I also refuse to exchange N's.
,I am not sure why Charles played this.  But, I felt that throwing in some checks was the way to go.
,I attempt to force another exchange with Rb1+ in mind.
,But, Charles refuses by half pinning my Nd5.
,I decide to exchange pawns in order to place him in check, regardless.  I'm asking myself what I could do after that.
,I quickly figured out that there is nothing else.  As my Rooks aren't doubled.  For, had one Rook been out, I would've been able to do the other and ambush the King.  But, that will not work, in this position.
,So, I get a little aggressive by attacking his Bc4.
,And, I push my passed pawn being that it's protected by my Ne3.
,The surprise is that he hits my a2 pawn.  So, I protect since 28.a3 will lose it at once to 28...Ra2  Therefore, the next move is the only option.
,Now comes nasty which I overlook.
,As I am fixated on trying to protect the other pawn.  But, better was 29.Red1 to delay or maybe even prevent what comes next.
,As two Rooks on the same rank are very dangerous.  But, it's not the worst that occurs as I missed the big picture.
,?? And, that was by playing this move.  The idea was to protect the pawn since Charles was threatening to win a pawn.  But, it was still a lost position.  However, I think that it would've been difficult for Charles to win.  This move, however, makes it even, as I'm gonna lose another piece without anything in return.  So, best was 30.g3, as then I could get out of this situation with 31.Ng2.
,With that, I resigned here.  Against someone closer to my strength or not as strong, I'd continue after 31...Nxg4 and hope for a draw, generally by stalemate.  But, something draw by rep or 50 move rule.  But, against someone of this strength, I don't stand a chance.  And, with it, there is nothing else to learn from this position, so I felt that resignation was called for here.

"This seemed a reasonable move, gaining the two bishops in an open board. Fritz likes Nb3 or Qe2.

"After learning 1. e4 opening, Now a day i am practicing queens Pawn opening with several variation. So 1. d4
,He stuck directly in the center that is ok but little bit unusual for me because when i open with d4 the usual response of maximum player here is Nf6.  
,So i play queens Gambit.
,gambit decline and a perfect response with c6. The other option may be defend d5 with Nf6. 
,I continue developing and putting pressure on d5. 
,So the he continue developing and defending d5 with Nf6.
,whenever opportunity comes I am always happy to pin the knight (BTW it is still not pinned against black queen due to e7 pawn) rather than develop any of bishop on f4 or c4. 
,So he add another defender to d5 if in case his knight at f6 fall. Although, I never want an exchange of bishop with Knight at f6 or c6 unless it is forced or make opponent position week after exchange. 
,With e3 i an now able to develop my lsb but i will be very cautious to loss of tempo in this variation. Particularly, after development of bishop at d3 black just take c4 pawn to force me to regain material equality but lose tempo.  
,He continues developing. This is another move i like to play if opportunity comes as connected knight are very good combo. 
,Qc2!!!!. at the time of making this move my main purpose to confuse my opponent and guessing his intent of attack. See, not a single piece of king side out from the hut. They are still sleeping. 
,after black response of Qa5,  i realize Qc2 is an inaccuracy because black intent is clear to use pin of my knight at c3 and exploit my queen side. 
,oops!!! another inaccuracy as suggest by post game computer analysis at chess.com. Analysis suggest a better line as  (7. Nf3 7... Bb4 8. Bxf6 8... Nxf6 9. Bd3 9... dxc4 10. Bxc4 10... Nd5 11. Bxd5 11... exd5) 
,of course wtih Ne4 black start to multi threaten me as i also do something to my dsb at d5.   
,SO i just move to a safer place. 
,Analysis suggest this is first inaccuracy from black side. The better one he suggest is immediate g5.  
,So i am going to take this knight???
,Black combination is good here he keep active his most favorite position e4. 
,Where my common sense goes and why not my favorite Ne2. Computer analysis rated this as a mistake. 
,he takes

"again, a move that probably only a chess machine would understand: most likely preparing Nf8, but prohibiting Nd8; this was the last call for a6, a4, a5, b5, Nb4, to prevent more trouble...
,made possible by the seemingly insignificant Rb1, a while ago: also here, h5 was very strong; but we wait for the right moment...
,here is the moment: f5 comes too late; after a5, b5, Nb4, Qc3, f6!, h5, g5, Black would have at least had some control; now, White is unleashed...
,after Na5, h5...
,maybe not the best - which is of course h5 -  but since Black is in an awkward position already - with virtually no pieces developed - we can easily prepare g4 to crack open all defenses...
,not the best way to prevent g4; best here was probably a6, Kf1 (the White King has to leave the bottom row at some point, after g4, fxg3, Rxg3, and Kg2), Rg8...
,after fxg3, Rxg3, Rg8, Ng5, the plot thickens...
,also here, a direct h5 spells a lot of trouble for Black; but we have time on our side, and Ndf3 looks pretty lethal...
,Kg7, Ndf3, h6, Nh3...
,directly winning is Bxg6, Rg8 (hxg6, Qxg6 ends all), Nxh7, bxc5, h5!... but I was kept busy by just understanding this machine...
,the losing move: after c4, Bxg6, hxg6, Qxg6, Rf8 (to prevent Nf7+), Black might still have something to play for; this ends it rapidly...
,after Kg7, Qxc7, threatening Qxd8+!, Qxd8, Nxe6+, recapturing the Queen...
,Kg7, Rh7+, loses the Queen...
,also Bxg6, d3, Qxc7, wins easily...
,not the way, to get out of this; the only realistic try was Qxh7, Nxh7, Kxh7, Ng5+, Kh8, and hope for complications...
,after Bxg6, to be followed by Nxe6, I feared Qxf3; of course totally unjust, because of Ng5 covering for Nf3 (at the moment)... but the pieces are sometimes hard to recognize on this board; all this apart from the mesmerizing graphics I was experiencing at that moment: truly distracting...
,the lost Bishop finally emerges, but way too late: after Nf8, Qxc7, Rd7, Qxc8, Rxh7, Nxh7, Kxh7, Qb7+, Nbd7, Qxa8, Black can safely give up...
,postponing the stronger Nxe6, with mate in all variations; but this works also... after this, the Thinking Machine went in full Guru mode, to be never heard of again; obviously resigning was not built into this algorithm... unfortunately, this great piece of software has one serious flaw: it castles under check; otherwise a true piece of art... go check it out, because it plays a mean game of chess also...

,or Ra6: nothing can save a5 any longer...
,this is losing; much safer would have been Rb1, to support b3...
,suddenly, Black is caught up in a mate trap; f5 being the killer here... plus: d4 is about to ruin control over the b-pawn... best is Ke8, d4, g6, to hold f5; White of course can always trade pawns via Rb7...

"As I took back with the N.  I had considered 18.Qxf4 but didn't want to exchange Queens.  As I'm just ready to do that, yet.
,?? This is where Coach Stockel does his money in the bank as I mentioned in comparison to money in the back from elyhim.  This wasn't just a blunder, but rather, Jack intentionally made it to see if I'd follow up with the right response.  It's very important to note, as he told when we were saying goodbye, that it took Mr. Stockel 10 minutes to find this move.  Thus, I should win easily.  How can white win?
,?? The logic behind that question is that I overlooked the right move.  And, when I did, Jack did his usual and embarrassed me in front of the other students.  He did this by going back the position right after the previous move (18...Qxe5) when the game was over, and then, asking the same question that I asked.  I am sure that his goal is not to embarrass people.  Instead, his goal is to teach his other students, as there is an important reason this mistake occurred and a lesson affiliated with it.  So, he wants his students to learn.  With that being said, the solution to the problem is 19.Bd4!  As now, with my Qg3 and DSB, I am threatening mate on g7.  Meanwhile, the Queen is threatened, and if Jack is to move that Q, he will get mated.  Of course, not moving it or bringing to f6 (which also prevents mate) will result in 20.BXQ winning the Queen for Bishop.  So, long and short, there would be no way for Jack to protect his Queen.  But, the reason I made this mistake is that, in the wrong context, I tried to apply what ION told me about short range tactics.  As there appears to be two attackers against one defender.  What I overlooked is that his Queen is on the same line as my DSB.  And, being that he captured the pawn which protected my Bc5, Jack can and will capture.  Thus, I am down a piece without compensation.  In part is because when Jack captures I will be in check.  There's even more then what it appears to be, though.  To make matters worse, as per what Ken has asked me before, besides this move, nothing else came into consideration.  The problem is what Jack directly stated to me.  Whereas it took him 10 minutes to find the previous move, it only took me 30 seconds to play this move.  That is exactly why Jack embarrassed me in front of the other students.  The idea was to teach them why you don't rush.  But, that is especially true for the tournament.   Instead of rushing, you should come close to or even use up your time (timeout, lose on time.)  What he told everyone and reemphasized to me is that you must take your time.  As rushing can and often does cause something like this to happen.  
,Jack opts to liquidate.
,But, being a piece down, I refuse, and instead, attack his Q.  As I realize that white can win a pawn, as one thirds compensation for lost material.  By one thirds compensation, I mean compensating a third of what I lost. 
,He counterattacks.
,Feeling like I'm getting something back, I take.  That's because instead of being an entire piece down, I now have a pawn, in return.  But, it's certainly enough, though.
,As Jack protects.
,And, I try to get my other Rook into action for a K side assault.
,But, this move proves that it's too little too late.
,As Jack is trying to exchange Rooks.  With this move, I'm worried about 25...Rxe1+, 26.Nxe1 Qf1#.
,?? But, this loses right away.  Though, being a piece for pawn down, Jack would've won, but it would be a lot more difficult.  In other words, we wouldn't be talking a clear cut win.  But, it is now, as I overlooked something important.  With that being said, much was to move my Re1 off of the e file.
,What I thought would work here was 26.Nxe1 Qf1+ Kg2  But, what I forgot is that 26...Qf1# is still mate, even with what appeared to be, a window open as Susan Polgar put it.  The other variation which I don't is not recapturing and playing 26.Kg2 (leaving me a R down to which things appeared safe.)  But, he'd mate the same way being 26...Qf1#  So, there's no way around it.  I saw that right after he captured.  Consequently, I resigned here.  As noted, when that happened, that's when Jack went back to what I should've played with the other students.  Then he reminded me of how important it was to take some time.  So, that was one of three morals to this game.  The other one is what Kenneth_fiore_3 has stressed in previous annotations which he directly stated with this game.  So, he told to remember that, ""When you see a good, look for something better.""  Remembering, though, what that ION said to sometimes play it when you see a good move, I mentioned why I thought it would work before realizing that the Queen was there.  That's when he said, ""Why bother with a piece.  Forget about it as you could've won.  Don't go for a piece when you can win the game.""  Out of the three morals, I'd say that the first one of taking your time is the most important one.  As this is what happened in some of my other games.  As I went much too fast to see that I could've won.   In fact, while we were saying good bye Jack told me that during those 10 minutes he said to himself that if I found the right move, I'd win.  And, if not, I'd lose, but he was hoping that I would find the winning move which didn't happen.  With that being said had I spent, not even one, but several (at least 5 minutes) I would've seen, and thus, played 19.Bd4!  After which, it would've been game over for Jack, at once.

"He takes.
,I take back.
,Knight drops back attacking the pawn. Now I figured I need not protect the pawn, as if he takes I have e5xd4 discovering an attack on his knight. Fritz seemed to like Qe7 here, at first, but I thought that wasted a move, if he exchanged on e5, so I played another developing move.
,Making way for my Bc8 to get into the game. Given time, Fritz eventually settled on this move too.
,This move was a surprise to me - but I am not sure it is that good.
,This seems the natural developing move, although Fritz seems to prefer exchanging on d4.
,So he exchanged. 14. Nxe5 loses the knight to f6 15. Ng4 h5 and the knight has run out of squares.
,Clearly the best way of recapturing, threatening to take on a2 in some variations.
,This more or less puts paid to any ideas of taking on a2. If I take with the rook he exchanges rooks and then traps my bishop with b2-b3, and if I take with the bishop b2-b3 immediately.
,Protecting my pawn on e4.
,Definitely ruling out any capture on a2! 
,I maintain the tension on e5. Fritz seems to prefer exchanging on d4.
,Now that the rook is no longer needed on a1.
,This is probably a mistake by me. I was dreaming of a king's side attack! Fritz again likes exchanging on d4.
,He initiates a series of exchanges to get his rook to the 7th rank.
,I take,
,He takes back.
,I take again.
,He gets the rook to the 7th rank. ""What of it?"" I thought. ""I can always drive the rook back with Be6 or Be8."" Which one is better dear reader and why?
,This is what I played. I overlooked his reply. Having said that, Fritz actually prefers Be6 and thinks it is still level.

"?! When I play as black against Ted, this is how it always start.  But, I didn't expect this move.  In fact, I feel that I might have a slight advantage here because this crams in his Bf1 which I will try to take advantage.  That's why I deem it is inaccurate.
,With the situation that I mentioned, I've got development in mind and start doing it.
,I guess that Ted has the same thing in mind.  What I kept in mind is that obviously prevents a later 3.c4.  But, I asked myself the chance that he'll play Nb5.  And, I realized that, on top of development, one reason that white might have played this was to allow 5.Nb5.
,So, I prevent that at once.
,I don't know why Ted played this.  Maybe, he wanted a semi open file.  But, it doesn't help with his development or center control.
,So, I pin right away.
,I expected 6.Be2 since that's the most common way to break the pin, as Coach Stockel has mentioned.  This is ok to.
,As usual, I asked myself what to do.  I didn't exchange just due to the important dream.  Before that, when I wasn't sure, if it were N for B, I'd exchange just because it was possible.  So, it was still being too readisome to do it.  Then, came a lesson with GM Susan Polgar at Polgar University 2017.  In a very small segment she talked about exchanging and said that even N for B doesn't mean you should exchange.  Instead, you should only engage in an even exchange when there is an immediate advantage.  Then came the dream, and that's when the lord said that I still need to change my thought process and not think that exchanging gets rid of my problems.  On top of what Ken said, that's also where I realize that Jack was wrong by advising me to exchange whenever possible against stronger players.  As Susan implied that being up against stronger opposition is even more of a reason to not just go into exchanges.  But, here, I asked myself what choice do I have.  For example, after 6...Bh5, which I considered 7.g4 Bg6.  Forgetting that the other N was exchanged, I had Ghost Vision and thought 8.Nf4.  Once again, I jumped the guns but there since in that situation, an exchange is forced, sooner or later.  My other thinking was that I didn't want to be forced to retreat to e6 where the center is blocked or move to d7 where it has less mobility.  And, I didn't want to undevelop my B to c8.  So, I thought that the best option was this move to prevent the worries.  Well, my assessment and thought process was wrong due to the Ghost Vision.  Had I remembered that one of his N's was exchanged and where it would go, my assessment would've been correct.  So, much better was 6...Bh5, as 7.g4?! and not only do I retreat to g6, but his K would, at the very least be weakened which favors black.
,?! With that being said what I had expected would been best which is 7.Qxf3, as now, Ted's K side is weakened even more then what I noted earlier due it not just being advanced but having those doubled pawns.  That would be an asset if white is to castle later on.
,Trying to find a good spot for my undeveloped B, I fianchetto.  It'll have better mobility this way then by advancing the e pawn.  That's because it'll cover more squares.  Although I didn't review that as important with a lecture by easy19, GM Susan Polgar said that how many squares a B is extremely important.
,Getting ready to exchange.  I really wanted to say no and was, therefore, tempted to play 8...Nfd7.  But, that would've appeared to cramp my less Q side as that gives me less mobility and would make it difficult to develop my Nb8.
,And, that is exactly why I played this.  As now, I'm ready in case Ted decides to exchange since I'll bring the d7 N to a better square.
,Breaking through in the center.  I did ask myself if exchanging works.  Susan was specifically alluding to pieces, btw.  But, Ken said that whether to exchange pawns or not is important.  I decided that it was the best way to go.  However, it's not as it appears being the thrills for exchanges.  Instead, there's a plan behind it.
,And, it's this move.  As I gain tempo.  The idea being is that once Ted retreats, I can, finally, complete my development and prepare to castle.
,With that being said, Ted continues with his development.  
,And, that's when I use my opportunity to castle, at once.
,I don't see the point of this move.  If it were to bring his R to the fourth rank it would make sense.  But, Ted doesn't do that.
,Seeing a potential weakness, I go after Ted's c pawn with which he defends.
,And, I play this.  The idea being that, in general, you want to play your R behind the Q.
,Ted's goal is to exchange.  For a few minutes, I asked myself if that's a good idea.  Well, there was another move that I considered.  That was, believe it or not, 16...Qxd4?? since the B is cramped.  But, I realize that he'd uncramp by winning my Q as they are on the same line.  In the end, I did it as this doubles Ted's pawn again.  More importantly, I am analyzing a variation that appears to win a pawn starting with this move, but there was something that I miscalculated.

"So after a win in round 2 (see my last annotated game,) I eventually managed to win on time in round 3, so with 2.5 out of 3 I was paired against this guy, the tournament's strongest player, who went on to win the tournament outright with 4.5 out of 5, conceding a draw to the second highest ranking player in the last round. I was the third highest ranked player in the tournament, and so to lose the last two rounds and only finish on 50% was a bit of a disappointment, although the games are not sent for grading or anything.
,We both rattled out the first few moves.
,Incidentally this was reconstructed after the game, and I am not 100% sure of the move order.
,Reaching a standard King's Indian Position. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence
,As usual I play the Sämisch Variation, named after Friedrich Sämisch, who developed the system in the 1920s. This often leads to very sharp play with the players castling on opposite wings and attacking each other's kings.
,Standard development.
,Black plays the Panno Variation: 6...Nc6, named after Oscar Panno, is a sharp and highly theoretical system which can lead to very complicated play. Black holds back the c-pawn for the time being, and aims to put the knight on d4. The immediate plan is to prepare queenside counterplay with ...a6, ...Rb8 followed by ...b5.
,The usual way of meeting it, so that if 7...e5 black can't play Nd4. After 7. Qd2 e7 8. d5 Nd4! with advantage to black because if 9.	Bxd4?	exd4
10.	Qxd4?	Nxe4
,Again the usual move.
,White prepares to play 0-0-0 in some variations.
,Black is preparing b7-b5 should white castle on the queen side.
,Opening up the diagonal for the Bf1.
,Taking advantage of the white knight moving away from e2.
,I played this quickly without thinking. I thought it was the standard move in this variation, but I see now that 10. d5 is more commonly played, and does get better results.
,He takes.
,I take back.
,He takes again.
,I take back.

"I don't make many errors in this game, but my first one is enough to finish me off, the others being incidental. An interesting variant of the Italian game.
,Castling, instead of playing 4.c3 obviously invites an attack on the e-pawn.
,White doesn't defend the attacked pawn, but goes straight on the attack. Clearly 5...Nxd4 loses the e-pawn; 5...Bb6 seems unnecesarily passive; 5...exd5, I learn, leads to the Max Lange Attack, which I do not fancy facing, so...
,This seems to give Black the most winning chances, at least according to the database!
,The Knight can easily be driven away, but for now White's e-pawn is attacked.
,Once again White leaves defence for later and continues to attack. In a way it's a great demonstration of how to utilise having the first move; Black is continually on the back foot, so to speak.
,Defending the pawn and renewing the attack on the e-pawn. We're still comfortably in the database with Black having the best of the games.
,Now this is a really wicked move. The analysis has me slightly ahead, but it's clear that White is going to disrupt my K-side pawns at some point, the only plus being that if he does I will have an open file against his King.
,Inviting an exchange that will allow me to return my Knight from its outpost before it's attacked. the more popular database move, 9...Qe7, was probably better.
,My dark-squared Bishop has gone, so I can't punish this by doubling and isolating White's pawns. Not is it there to interpose on e7. Maybe allowing the Max Lange attack was safer?
,I certainly don't want too much pressure on f7 so I exchange.
,The computer has the game level, but I'm not convinced, despite White's isolated pawn. My Knight is pinned, my e-pawn is attacked and White has open files for his Rook and Queen. And I haven't castled. It may be just as well, as those K-side pawns are going to get messed up.
,In the meantime I defend my pawn.
,Here it comes...
,At least I have an open file of my own to attack down.
,White dislodges my sole advanced piece.
,I'm driven away, but I can attack g2 via f4 from here.
,I'm unsure of the point of this move, unless it's to prevent my Knight going to c5? I'm surprised, actually, that we are still in the database.
,I suppose I'd hoped for 15.g3, to allow my Knight to go to h3.
,At this point, the only remaining game has a continuation of 15...Qe6, attacking the Knight, but I want to get my Rook onto the open file as quickly as possible. Significantly, this is where the analysis has the turning point of the game.

,Any other Queen retreat, as we know, would've lost material.  But, with it, I take advantage of the opportunity to liquidate since I'm ahead.  As that's generally what you want to do.
,As in the aftermath, his Nf6 is left indirectly pinned.  With that, I use the moment to attack his d5 pawn.  When he defends... 
,I attack his Queen by centralizing my Rook.  When Perry retreats...
,I play this.  Seeing that his N is still pinned, this move also attacks twice.  But, there's more to it, for when he breaks the pin, I accomplish a short term goal.  It is based on a variation on a move that Ken recently asked me if I had considered.  That was during my win against Jack Stockel as it would have doubled up his K side pawn structures.  In which, I might have been happy afterwards.  Well, that is about to happen here, and I am quite here.  But, if that's not enough, there's even more as we'll see soon.
,?? As Perry breaks the pin this way.  But, after the game we played through some variations, and it turns out that this is the losing blunder.  It looks like black isn't going to lose any more material.  However, the real threat is against his King.  And, that threat is unavoidable now.  As Jack pointed out, best was 18...Ne4  And, despite moving a pinned N, it doesn't lose any more material since my Queen is attacked.  After I retreat, he analyzed what happens after I believe it was 19...Rc8  From there, we continued after the game.  It turns out that with being a piece up and not allowing counterplay, including the stalemate ideas, I would've won.  But, it would've been very difficult.  And, I would not have won until the very end.  With this move, however, it is over very quickly in a way that I almost overlooked.  The only way around that is to take back with his Queen, instead.  But, it would still be lost.  As now, you're talking about a free Q, and I would do whatever possible to prevent counterplay.  He obviously saw that and doubled up his pawns which will end the game even faster.
,With those doubled pawns and weakened King, along with my Nh5, I add another attacker.  Had it not been for my loss against bhidragon, I would've overlooked this.  However, after I made a terrible blunder and hyperfocused developing my Nb1, this was his winning move.  I was only able to apply this technique once.  And, it was against Ted.  The win would've taken a little longer, but I would've either mated or won the Queen.  In that case, it was a checkmate.  But, in this position, it is a mate immediately.  Before playing this very move, however, I did ask myself a position somewhat similar to this that occurred with GM Susan Polgar in the mega bundle.  Since in that game it would've worked.  So, I asked myself what would happen if Perry moved his Rf8.  As it would be the question of can he defend and get the K out.  At first, I thought yes, but when I reanalyzed and saw where his K is, I determined that it's a no.  Unlike that game, Perry has only one move that he can make with his K, but it is not going to help which means that there is no escape here since it is, pretty much stuck in the corner.  With that, I played this as it forces an immediate win.
,The only move that would've delayed the mate was giving up the Queen with 20...Qxh2+, but after I recapture, the position is the same, and there is no way out.

"Sono d'accordo con Klaus per quanto riguarda le mosse successive e l'analisi. Credo che in questa situazione ci sia una lezione importante per tutti gli scacchisti all'ascolto. Difatti, io nella mia analisi, di cui vi ho messo a parte, non ho nemmeno contemplato la possibilità del sacrificio di torre. Nel mettermi nei panni dell'avversario, ho pensato come un ELO 1750. Io normalmente non faccio mosse così brillanti. Per contemplarla, avrei dovuto pensare come un ELO 2000   Perciò, per crescere, pensate in grande! (e imparate dalle sconfitte   )

Dopo:
18. ... Txd6
19. exT Cb4+
20. Rb1 Cxd3

sorprendo Klaus facendo... quello che suggerisce   ovvero:

21. Txf6

Penso di avere concrete speranze di recuperare un pedone, e di far valere la minaccia del mio pedone passato. Ma non è molto. 
,Logicamente prendo di pedone (fxTe6). Ora mi aspetto che Stefano, che tralasciando l'avventata mossa 18. e5   ha giocato egregiamente, vada ad insidiare il mio cavallo con la sua torre.

Tralasciando di pensare al prossimo risultato della partita, vorrei spendere poche parole su questo modo di postare le mosse in bella vista di tutti coloro che, interessati ad una specifica apertura o per capire quali ragionamenti scorrono sulla testa di altri giocatori, si inseriscono nel forum dando ognuno la propria opinione.

Ho cercato altre volte di piantare questo germe di interesse, senza un eccessivo successo. Questa volta però ho l'impressione che stiamo andando verso la giusta direzione.
Considero Stefano un ottimo partner di scacchiera. Mi piace il suo modo di giocare e il modo di esporre le sue teorie.

Ripeto che il risultato non ha alcun valore. L'importante è il modo di esporre il gioco e cercare di attizzare il maggior interesse e consenso possibile.

Chiunque può intervenire nel forum della partita dicendo la propria e non deve assolutamente farsi restio a dare la propria opinione o proposta pensando che la stessa possa sembrare debole o priva di interesse; al contrario. E' ben spiegando le illogicità che alla fine si riesce a costruire un ragionamento logico. Pertanto dite la vostra sia ora che nelle prossime partite dove cercheremo di studiare altre aperture o varianti.


,Ti ringrazio, Klaus, per l'apprezzamento e per i complimenti. Anch'io penso che non conti il risultato, quando si impara qualcosa, si vince sempre. E penso che tu sia un ottimo istruttore.

Venderò caro l'ermellino, in questa partita, che però ha dato già i suoi utili messaggi. La variante Sämisch, tutta d'attacco e contro la quale occorre un incisivo contrattacco. La necessità di pensare con la testa e con il livello dell'avversario. Tante metafore belliche e astrofisiche  

E' arrivata l'ora dei riservisti... Td1. Mi aspetto Cf2, poi potrei fare Te1 e recuperare il pedone, se tutto va bene. Cf4 sembra buona per il nero ma non lo è, provare per credere.

22. Td1 

,Il mio cavallino, come da Stefano supposto, va in f2.

Un consiglio disinteressato, Te1 da parte del bianco sarebbe un nuovo grave errore.
Infatti dopo:

22. Td1 Cf2
23. Te1 Ag2
24. Tf1 Axc3
25. Txf2 Td8 
,.
,.
,.
,.
,Penso di parlare a nome di tutti, dicendo che abbiamo pensato che fossi giustamente indaffarato con il nuovo torneo, pertanto non hai nulla di che scusarti   . Anzi, grazie per l'impegno che profondi.

Mi ero riproposto di fare Te1? Accidenti. Questo è uno dei nemici dello scacchista, si chiama “calo di motivazione”. In pratica quando si pensa di stare perdendo la partita, la si è già persa, E la qualità delle mosse va di conseguenza. Da non confondere con il “calo di concentrazione” che avviene quando si pensa di aver vinto. In tutt’e due i casi, il disastro è dietro l'angolo.
Ho esaminato la sciagurata 23. Te1 sotto un altro punto di vista, la possibilità di sacrificare il cavallo per un tempo, per poter permettere dopo Txe6 l'avanzata del pedone d, c'è un certo pericolo per il nero ma la semplice contromossa di spostare il re in colonna f rende tutto inutile.
Dunque, Tf1. Klaus a questo punto gioca Ad2. A me non conviene lo scambio di cavalli, perché poche mosse più tardi Klaus si ritrova il pedone in e5 e l'alfiere in d4, che si difendono l’un l'altro, in una configurazione che amo (quando riesco a farla) ma odio affrontare, e per giunta in Piazza Duomo. No no, 24. Cb5 Ce4, come giustamente suggerito da Klaus.
A questo punto, sono indeciso tra due mosse. Cc7 porta ad uno scambio di pedoni, poi il mio cavallo deve tornare indietro sui suoi zoccoli perché da e6 non c'è dove andare. Più interessante mi sembra Rc2, che porta il re in mezzo all'arena, dove dovrebbe stare nel finale. Inoltre si potrebbe creare una situazione interessante e caotica dopo Td1. Siccome sono sotto di materiale, il caos dovrebbe essere mio amico. Mi aspetto Td8 con il nero che propone lo scambio di pedoni.

23. Tf1 Ad2
24. Cb5 Ce4
25. Rc2 
,Ora è il momento di ragionarci su e proporre un bello scambio di pedoni. Regalo il pedone a7 per eliminare quello in d6. Penso che Stefano forse accetterà. Altra possibilità è Td1. Ma dopo a6 il pedone d6 sarebbe egualmente cancellato dalla scacchiera.
Siamo ad un momento del gioco che generalmente gioca a vantaggio di chi è in vantaggio. Infatti il bianco, privo di un pezzo, si trova a dover difendere la propria formazione delegando ai propri pezzi troppi compiti. In un finale un alfiere in grado di scorrazzare libero diventa una mina vagante.
Io personalmente opterei per lo scambio di pedoni. Un piccola speranza di far avanzare i propri pedoni sul lato di donna, tre contro uno, potrebbe riaccendere le tenui speranze del bianco.
Comunque vediamo cosa decide (l'imprevedibile ) Stefano.


,Sì, Klaus ha ragione, Td1 non mi conviene perché, pur garantendo lo scambio di pedoni dopo:

26. Td1 a6
27. Cc7 Txd6
28. Cxa6

Non mi consente una mossa brillante (almeno mi pare così, spero che la mia non sia la solita fanfaronata   ), ovvero:

26. Cxa7 Txd6
27. Cc8!

, E la torre non può difendere il pedone b6 con Tc6 per via di Ce7+ . A questo punto potrei avere tre pedoni passati e legati (wow) con la mia torre dietro: un'ottima prospettiva.

L'alternativa per il nero è:

26. … Cxd6
27. Cc6
(il mio re non può prendere subito l'alfiere per via di Cb5+ che guadagna il cavallo)
27. … Ta8
28. Rxd2 Txa2+
29. Re muove Txg2

Con guadagno di un tempo in cambio del pedone, per difendere il pedone h. Direi molto migliore per il Nero, anche se cala il sipario sulle scorribande del suo alfiere.

Comunque vediamo cosa succede:

26. Cxa7 
,Mi piacciono le divagazioni di Stefano. Certe rispecchiano un certo ottimismo  .
Io purtroppo sono molto più essenziale. Generalmente non mi discosto molto dalla linea o combinazione che mi sono prefissata. Pertanto, come programmato in precedenza, togliamo dalla scacchiera il pedone bianco che, in quella posizione, anche se solo soletto, mi infastidiva... la visuale  
Sono curioso di vedere quale delle molteplici continuazioni contemplate, verrà giocata. Un consiglio lo posso dare comunque a cuor leggero. Dimentica 27. Cc8!

,Orpo! Questa è veramente una sorpresa 🤔 Mi sono scervellato per un'ora per scoprire la variante assassina con cui Klaus mi distruggerà dopo 27. Cc8. Niente da fare, non l'ho trovata. O sono un pollo nell'analizzare le posizioni (possibile, coccodè!) o la variante è brillantissima. In questo secondo caso, anche a costo di perdere, la voglio vedere! Inoltre, non avendo trovato nessun pericolo pratico nella posizione, onestà intellettuale e curiosità chiedono a gran voce che io prosegua sulla mia linea, coerentemente coi miei ragionamenti; non sarebbe bello cambiare mossa per un ragionamento che non è mio. Se sarà la fine, spero che sia spettacolare come l'incendio dello Hindenburg.
E poi... ho già pronta una nuova proposta per una seconda partita di studio 😄
Hasta siempre Comandante!

27. Cc8 
,Non c'è alcuna variante assassina, solo che, contrariamente a quanto fatto fino ad ora, mi piace scoprire live il tuo metodo di ragionamento sulle prossime mosse.
Fino a Td8, che minaccia il tuo cavallo, il gioco non cambia molto. Interessante è ora vedere se preferisci la qualità o la quantità. Non voglio influenzarti con i miei punti di vista. Forse li riprenderò dopo la tua prossima mossa che voglio scoprire.
Dopo che l'avrai fatta continueremo a discutere  

,Ora l’ho vista, la mossa per cui Klaus mi aveva sconsigliato 27. Cc8. Dopo Td8:

28. Cxb6 Aa5
29. Ca3 Td2+

riguadagna il pedone e:

30. Rb2 Txg2
31. h4 Th2
32. Tf4 Cd2+

salva in extremis l’altro pedone ma mettendo il bianco in una brutta situazione. I pedoni passati ci sono ma la torre nera è dietro, e questo non va bene.

Sviluppiamo l'alternativa proposta da Salvatore:

28. Ce7+ Rg7
29. Cc6 Td6
30. Ce5 Ac3
31. Cd3 para la minaccia Td2+

In alternativa:

31. Tf7+ Rg8
32. Td7 obbliga il nero allo scambio di torri.

, perché:

32. … Td2+
33. Txd2 Axd2
34. Rd3 guadagna il cavallo o l'alfiere

Perciò:

32. … Txd7
33. Cxd7 Aa5
34. Rd3

e il mio re fa quello che a me piace tanto nel finale: si butta in centro a corona bassa   inoltre il mio cavallo è In settima, e non è poco. Penso di avere qualche speranza.

Ma le variabili sono tante, perciò una mossa per volta:

28. Ce7+

Una nota teorica: penso che anche conoscendo le conseguenze di Cxb6, avrei fatto ugualmente Cc8; penso che sia utile mettere sempre sotto pressione l'avversario, perlomeno quando non è un mostro sacro come Klaus  


,Effettivamente hai fatto la mossa che speravo, almeno nel tuo interesse, facessi. Ora, anche se chiaramente in vantaggio, l'incontro può continuare più bilanciato. Catturare il pedone b6 sarebbe stata l'inizio della fine  

Le prossime mosse sono come telefonate: Cc6 ( che minaccia la mia torre) Td6 che minaccia a sua volta il cavallo) e Ce5, seguito da Ac3 (che fa correre ulteriormente questo povero cavallino).

La partita a questo punto si sta preparando per un finale chiaramente in vantaggio per il nero, ma nella quale il bianco può continuare a difendersi almeno fino a quando le armate non cominceranno a diradarsi. Allora quel punto chi sarà in vantaggio di materiale probabilmente avrà la meglio. Da non sottovalutare però la spinta sul lato di Re del biaco con 3 pedoni contro uno... 
,.

,.

,Sono d'accordo sullo sviluppo delle prossime mosse:

28. Cc6 Td6
29. Ce5 Ac3

Passiamo perciò alla mossa 30. Lasciando da parte per il momento le scacchiere iperboliche di Antonio 😄 la scelta ricade su due mosse: Cd3 e Cf3. Entrambe impediscono Td2+, ma la seconda ostacola la colonna libera f per la torre. Inoltre, la prima mette il cavallo nei pressi del re e del famoso trio di pedoni. Dunque:

30. Cd3

Che cosa mi aspetto... sinceramente non so. È una fase di bonaccia. Forse Td4, per dare supporto al cavallo? Forse spinta dei pedoni g e h?

"Jack starts off with his usual.
,As do I, and of course, we're in the Open Variation.
,I forgot that 4...Nf6 is the most common move.  But, it doesn't matter, as I will transpose into that since right after that, white plays the next move, anyhow, of 5.Nc3.  Therefore, the same move occurs, but in a different order.
,As evidence, I was going to play this here, one way or another to develop and prepare to castle.
,I was wondering what to do here.  At first, I thought about attacking with 6...h6.  But, I was worried about putting compromises on my K, if I'm to castle.  Plus, for a similar reason, I'm not ready to exchange, yet.
,So, I impose a pin which I know can and will easily be broken.
,Continuing with his development and preparing to castle.
,As do I.  In order to do it right away without waisting time, this move was necessary, as in this position, it would not be wise to fianchetto, for the same reason why doubled fianchetto's are generally not wise.  After which, he and I are both going to castle which means that we're both thinking alike here.  The only thing that I wasn't ready for was the exchange which comes right after.  But, for me, it's not as important if I can get my K to safety since the idea is, ""Castle early and often"".  And, that is, btw, the main chess quote that I try to follow all the time.
,With the threat that I had, Jack, as expected, defends.
,So, I attack again.
,And, he defends again which enables me to impose a half pin on his Nf3.
,And, he breaks it.  As here, I was planning to exchange on f3 to mess up Jack's pawn structures.  Seeing the threat does not surprise me knowing that it wasn't going to be easy.  But, with the move played, however, I refuse to exchange since he can recapture with the Queen instead.
,So, I complete my development.
,Attacking my B, and presumably, trying to get a semi open file.
,And, for the reason noted earlier, I wasn't willing to exchange here.
,I am not sure why Jack played this.
,But, wondering and then not knowing what else to do here, I am now ready to exchange since I can't think of anything and don't want to get into complicated variations against him. 
,Trying to exchange Queens.
,But, I refuse.  However, I think that taking on d5 would've been better because of what's to come since Jack's Queen is going to become a monster.
,As he is threatening mate.

"Not surprisingly, Jack opted for the Spanish Opening.  The reason I was going to play it is that I'm most used to it.  
,For a while, Carl didn't know what to do.  In fact, he was inclined to play the Berlin Defense.  Jack said that it was a good move and nothing wrong with it.  But, this move, however, is more common, so his advice was to play it since his idea is playing moves that are most analyzed by masters and grandmasters.
,Jack also told Carl that he could hit my B again but he wanted to Carl to continue developing.
,So, I play it as though Carl played the Berlin Defense.  In fact, this could be a transposition into just that because after 4...Nf6 5.0-0, I seem to remember playing one game that then followed with 5...a6 6.Ba4 b5 7.Bb3.  Well, we're seeing the same thing but in a different order.  So, it's certainly a transposition, and I believe that it is with the very same defense.  The real reason behind this move is because of what Carl wants to do.
,As he was about to play 5...Nxe4  But, as noted, you have to think of this like a training game with Kenneth_fiore_3.  That's because Jack didn't allow Carl to capture on e4.  He said that taking there would be a mistake since white can answer with 6.Re1.  Afterwhich, I'd have the advantage.  Well, I don't completely agree that I'd get an initiative, but rather, I'd call it even since those moves have been played before.  In fact, cplusplus11 showed me an example, and I believe that game ended in a draw since it's all in book, and therefore, blends in theory.  With that being said, had he taken, I would've stayed in book by centralizing the Rook on e1.  Therefore, he told Carl to play this.  After which, as noted, it has transposed, and possibly into the Berlin Defense.  But, what I do is that this is interesting.
,Not surprisingly, Carl takes advantage of his fianchetto.
,Not really sure what to do, I decide to threaten Carl's f7 pawn because of what I learned from TA.  And, what I apply to teach my students from his blitz Q sac is what GM Susan Polgar previously mentioned based on how important the f pawn is.  So, I target that square.
,Not surprisingly, he defends.  And, Jack gave this as his best move.  Right now, I must exchange to avoid losing a pawn.
,But, right here is where my thought process and judgement starts to go down.  It's actually something that Ken has seen before.  Similar to another game, I didn't know what else to do.  Therefore, without thinking twice about it, I just exchange.  And, yes, I am back to doing it just because it is possible to do so.  The problem to is that I didn't give this time, either.  As after Carl takes back, I will harass the Queen which is just something that I enjoy doing.  For, had I taken a little longer, I would've either fianchettoed with 9.b3, or I might have developed with 9.d3.  The thing, however, is that nothing came into consideration, aside from this move.  It was right here that I start becoming impatient.  I think the reason behind is that I was still upset about all of the insults towards TA that it took away all of my concentration.  This is also why after complaints were made, I made the personal prayer that GK would suspend that club which is what happened.  As those kinds of things and getting all upset after a club war or insults towards a good teacher and friend has gotten the best of me.  That is what happened here. 
,But, what I forgot is that it doesn't give me time to continue developing right away since my Ng5 is attacked.  
,As now, Carl is the one ahead in development.
,And, with an added defender, I decide to centralize my Rook at once.  Jack told Carl that this is no worry, as it can be easily dealt with by castling.  As usual, I agree with coach Stockel.
,Which I anticipated, as now, I open up a diagonal for my Bc1.
,That, however, gives Carl to defend again by centralizing his Rook.
,As bad as it sounds, I didn't give a lot of thought either.  In fact, it was only very slightly more then before which led to the previous exchange.  But, the only thing that I was thinking about was preventing Carl attacking my Nf3.  The problem is that I was impatient enough to overlook that this wasn't possible because of my Nc3.  By doing this, the exchanges favors black.  And, I also didn't give mobility enough consideration because what happens here is very similar to what occurred with my second game against Ken.  With better mobility, black is going to win a piece with, at most, a pawn in return which also favors Carl.
,Still being upset with those insults, as noted, I figure that I'll just exchange again.  And, the only reason is that Carl is in check.  I think part of it is given that I can't take his Nd4 which was my plan.  So, not thinking about it hard enough, I figure that exchanging is the answer to all of my problems since nothing else came into consideration here either.  The problem is that it does not fix my problems either.
,As I couldn't take on d4, due to the threat, I decide to add an attacker with my LSB.
,But, Jack recommended this move to Carl.  Believe it or not, I almost made a blunder, as 18.Bxd4?? came into consideration.  In fact, I was very close to playing it, but then, I saw the threat that Carl has against me.  And, I weighed it in with what I learned from GM Susan Polgar which is also something that Jack mentioned in a loss against Tom Walsh.  And, it boils down to what your opponent wants to do.  In this case, Jack wants me to take to allow the mate.
,But, I saw it and put a stop to it.  Jack said, ""Oho, you saw that threat.""  And, I said that I'm not going to allow the mate against me since K safety is vital.
,So, Jack recommended this move.

"Reminder of the time limit - 40 moves in 90 minutes, plus 30 minutes if your time runs out before then, plus 30 second increment. Again I was late for the start, due to heavy traffic on the A55, I was about 10 minutes late. I hope to rattle out moves of a Sicilian Defence or a Grünfeld Defence, but it was not to be. I paused before playing...
,Probably leading to a King's Indian Defence reversed I thought.
,OK maybe a Queen's Indian Reversed I thought.
,So I played this.
,And then he comes up with this. I sank deep into thought. A reversed Budapest Defence! Never met it before! I considered dxe4. Now in the Budapest Defence, after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but that line has rather been put out of fashion by 4. a3! which stops any tricks based in ....Bf8-b4+. So I didn't really look at 3...dxe4 4. Ne5, thinking that 4.....a6 would refute it, and spent most of my time looking at 3....dxe4 4. Ng4, and all the complications of the Budapest Defence but with white having the extra move, which I decided to avoid. After the game my opponent showed me a trap, 3.... dxe4 4. Ne5 Qd4 5. Bb2 Qxb2 6. Nc3 and the black queen is trapped, for instance 6.....Qa3 7. Bb5+ and 8. Nc4. So after 3....dxe4 4. Ne5 is the most common move, and 4....a6 is the best next move. However I led the game down a different route.
,By playing this, I hoped to keep the position closed.
,He instantly whipped out this move.
,I felt I wanted to conserve my good light squared bishop and I didn't want him doubling my pawns after 4...Nc6 and him taking on c6 at some stage.
,He threatens to take my c pawn.
,So I hit his bishop.
,He takes.
,I take back this way, to give protection to d4.
,He takes.
,I take back.
,He attacks d4.
,Unable to safely protect it again, I advance it.
,He comes in with this fork. I realise that I am going to lose my d pawn as Qf3 is coming.
,I try this, hoping that he will take the d pawn and I will take on e4.
,But is plays this.
,I hit his knight.

"I start off with my usual.  Unlike with some players, I know Ted's style of play, and this will become the Spanish Opening.  I knew this from when I played this and play what I'm most used to and comfortable with.
,In fact, I knew that we'd get to this point.  But, what Ted does next is something that I haven't seen before.
,In all of the other games that I've played with him, Ted has played 5...Na5.  But, this came first.
,I also considered 6.d4?? but didn't want into the Noah's Ark Trap again.  That's because I now remember from a lesson with Ken in ION's recent annotation between and tombulous that you fall into the NOA trap with 6.d4.  But, 6.d3 and white is fine.  And, my intentions are the same which is opening up a line for my Bc1 to bring into play.
,Ted now plays the move the move that I had anticipated earlier.
,Thinking that he would force the exchange, I asked myself why waste time when another piece can be developed.  The truth is that I'm ahead in development and am trying to take advantage of this.  What I forgot is that Ted can play 7...b4 which would force my Nc3-e2, leaving me with a semi cramped position.
,But, he pins, instead.
,And, I break it right away.  This time, it's not just because Jack said that it was the most common way to break it.  Yes, it was one of the reasons.  But, the main reason is that if and when he retakes, I can and will now prevent being forced to double pawns by taking with the B, instead.  Were I black, though, I would've captured with 8...Nxb3, but I gather that Ted wanted to try something different.
,As now, Ted brings his back to where it was.  However, nothing stops me from winning a pawn on e5.
,And, I didn't capture with my N because I thought that Ted would recapture with his Nc6.  Although I'd still be a pawn up, the threat against f7 would be gone.  That's because I intend to threaten that by bringing my Nf3 to g5 or e5, at some point.  Also, with this move his Rook is threatened.
,It's understandable that Ted didn't want to liquidate do to being a pawn down.  But, it was necessary here because this will remove his pawn on the weakest.  And, as we know, you must always be aware of the f2 and f7 squares as they're the weakest on the board.  Once they're gone, you're in trouble, as I've learned with TA's blitz Q sacs.  Well, I kept that in mind.
,And, that is exactly why I exchanged here.  I normally would've waited, but on top of the weakness that Ted has, this also prevents him from castling.  And, as usual, my idea of a good time is being able to take away my opponents right to castle.  With those weaknesses, I felt that Ted had something to worry about.
,I also had this in mind when talking about depriving Ted of the right to castle given that the B controls the square where black would do this.  In other words, one of those files where you castle is controlled and attacked. 
,I don't know why Ted played this.
,But, I waist no time in castling given that I took advantage of the opportunity, with which, I took away from Ted.
,As I overlooked, Ted decides to discover an attack on my B.  
,? But, since his N moved away from the pawn which was protected, I felt that it was ok to take it.  Plus, I'm also threatening 15.Nf7.  However, this is where Jack gets involved.  And, he was horrified that I played this move.  In fact, he asked me why I didn't play 14.Bxb7, and I told him that I was not ready to exchange.   Then, Mr. Stockel told me that this was a terrible move.  Now, Ted didn't know what to do.  But, Jack told him that the best move was capturing.  In it he said, ""Take the Bishop.""  The logic was that he'd win a piece.  I realized that this doesn't because, if he takes, I can recapture.  I'm sure that he was thinking of something else.  I agree that this move is a mistake because preventing the loss of a piece should mean that he equalizes.
,But, Jack asked me the same question that Ken asked me a similar question to what Ken asked me in our second game.  This time, it led to a worse mistake.  It was a blunder.  Jack said, ""Now what?  What are you going to do now?""  
,?? I was originally thinking of 15.exd5.  But, asking that question made it seem like I was in trouble.  Therefore, I came up with a new plan.  My response was that I have to answer to that and checked this way.  He then asked, ""What's that going to do""?  I said that I was thinking about what happened when Perry played a bad move and allowed me to bring the Queen like this.  His response was, ""that's not going to work"", and I thought he was right because it shouldn't have..  What I was implying with Perry's move was the Domiano's Defense.  In the tournament game against Perry, I was white and he was black.  It started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6?! 3.Nxf6 exf6?? 4.Qh5 g6 5.Qxe5+ which allows white to win the Rook.  Well, after he asked me that, I thought that this variation might work and, as what I'm generally guilty of, got very comfortable and happy with my position.  That's because if black messes up, I will get the Rook and have a plan.  Luckily, it does work.  But, this move is a lot worse then the previous move.  His next move is a good example which turns it from just happy to Hope Chess where I hope that he won't see it which will allow me to achieve my goal.  It's also worth noting that after this move, while Jack looked at the game one more time, he didn't get involved any more because the remainder of his time was spent on the other game.   
,Instead of retreating, I advance with the same plan of winning the Rook.  Yet, it's still possible for Ted to retreat his B.

"The Old Steinitz Defence; the Modern Steinitz Defence interposes 3...a6 4.Ba4 before playing this.
,Apparently the best move, according to my reading!
,Stopping the pin, a problem is I play e5 witht he Knight still pinned!
,Black decides to open up the position right away!
,And again, the usual line being 6...g6 to allow the Bishop out.
,Black wants to exchange quickly because he knows I am not good at endgames.
,A little suspect, I would have thought, but it does drive away my Queen and lay claim to the d4 square.
,Now Black gets on with his development.
,Tempting to bring my Bishop out straight away, but I decide to develop it on b2 instead, and lay claim to the half-open file.
,Stops my Knight going to b5, but I was never going there anyway.
,Surely way too early for a Queen sortie? Still, after the exchanges and with both sides castled, the early advantage White enjoys seems to have gone!
,Black decides to keep his Queen in an attacking position, but he doesn't really have much.
,Inviting another exchange.
,As expected, Black is happy to hurry me on to the end game.
,However, he allows me to post my Queen centrally, attacking the b-pawn, and have that nice long diagonal for my Bishop.
,The b-pawn steps forward out of the line of fire.
,Forming a nice pawn chain, but rather open to attack now the b-pawn has advanced.
,Black wants to put his Bishop on the long diagonal, but needs to protect the d-pawn, the Queen still being rather out of position.
,It gives me time to allow my Rook to head for g3 and a K-side attack looming.

"You will note here that White takes with the bishop, yet after 12...Qe7, the rook capture would have been chosen.  One should always be on the lookout for little tweaks like this.  The King is being forced to move, which leaves him stranded in the middle of the board.  And to demonstrate the point that changing circumstances place different values on time, space and material considerations, White had a much better move than this check: 13.a4! This move is a bit harder to find, and its purpose a little obscure (force the Queen back, OR activate the rook after 13...bxa3 e.p.).  In fact I looked at the a4-move only in the context of a possible King hunt in the near future.
,14.a4 was still good.  But the course of play chosen by White is still good enough to win.  
,Another good defence.  In a desperate situation, Black is hanging on.
,Had I looked further ahead into this line, I might have played 15.c4 before this.
,[?] I was expecting the tougher 15...Kc7 16.Rf7ch, with a King hunt.
,Much, much better was 16.Qh5ch!  The bad part was that I looked at this move, too, but failed to pursue the line far enough: 16.Qh5 g6  17.Rxf8ch!! Rxf8  18.Qxh7 ... Having got this far, I ought to have seen this position was dead winning for White, but the apparently 'unforcing' nature of the position dissuaded me from exploring Black's real options at this point.  I barely glanced at it.  Silly me.
,A kind of a trappy move, offering the bishop in this way.  But I was really looking to the King hunt that ought to have followed.  Also strong was 17.e5, which move I also spent a lot of time looking at.  The reason for choosing the text was a certain special feature.
,That feature was this.  I always recommend to learning players: 'Never trust your opponent'.  If you see what looks like a blunder, you can suppose that it is, but make no such assumption.  Equally: you can suppose the apparent blunder disguises something sneakily nasty.  But do not assume so.  I am reminded of an old US acquaintance (TS) domiciled in my own country telling me about his victory over a Grandmaster - Larry Evans, I think it was, or it might have been Sammy Reshevsky.  At about move 9, the Great Man left a piece 'en prise'.  Our friend, TS, simply could not, for the life of him, figure out the plot.  What dastardly scheme did the GM have in mind?  So TS simply took the piece.  'I guess we'll find out now,' he thought.  He found out, all right!  Having made a simple blunder, the GM promptly resigned.  It happens to us all.  With GMs, it is a rarity, but not at all unknown.   Here, Black had to play 17...Kc7 though the following King hunt ought eventually to have cornered him: 18.Rf5 ... (I was actually thinking of the immediate Rf7ch, but this finesse is more decisive) 18...Qa7  19.Rf7ch ... [A] 19...Kb6 20.Bd8ch Kg5  21.Qd3ch Ka4 22.Bb3# or [B] 19...Kb8! 20.Qg4 Qc4!  21.d5!? Qc5ch   22.Kh1 Ra7 23.Rxa7 Qxa7  24.Bxc8 ... wins.
,The King has no moves.
,None of Black's rooks and bishops moved, and as such were not able to lend assistance to their beleaguered King.

"I anticipated this because this is also what he plays.  So, I stick with my usual for now.
,This move took me off guard.  But, it's a small way of learning how intense openings can be.  I'm used to seeing 2.Nf3 or even 2.d4 played in the Sicilian Defense.
,But, I am not intimidated yet and certainly not overwhelmed, as I calmly stick to my usual.  As I play the same move that I would've played were the other moves by black played.  Needless to say that there is nothing new from black here.
,That is, until Tom plays this.  Now, we're in unfamiliar territory.  And, although not taught this by kenneth_fiore_3 what I remember from Yoga class is that one must be calm and collected.  In other words, it's about keeping the gaze still and mind quiet.  That's what it takes to become a better, as in the past, even after that game, I'd feel overwhelmed and cope with the Fight or Flight Syndrome which is quite bad as it has caused me to rush which resulted in terrible mistakes that shouldn't have been made.  It's about knowing how to handle that unfamilar territory as I learned with charleshiggie in his past annotations.  Keeping the guaze still and mind quiet means staying calm at all times.  Be it note that the reason for mentioning Yoga is that what I was wondering for years was how to handle the Fight or Flight Syndrome.  The bad part is that no coaching or mentoring game has helped me with that.  Instead, all of my questions were answered by going to the Yoga classes, over the past 2-4 years.  
,Therefore, with meeting something new, I try something different, as well.  And, that's by calmly developing on the Q side.  I'm just thinking about what this N, in the long term might be capable of doing.  And, what comes to mind is what I learned in the Deeper Chess Theory Club about the N visualization count.  With that, one of the things I'm asking myself is what I learned from GM Susan Polgar and kenneth_fiore_3.  So, the real question is can I bring this N to a more active post.  If it's yes, then that will play a powerful role.
,I guess that Tom is asking himself the same question.
,Meanwhile, I develop the other N with ideas of castling later on.
,As does he.
,Not knowing what else to do, I fianchetto.  Be it worth noting that I like forming the nice long flanks.  So, if I don't if there's anything wrong with it or not, I just assume that it's good move.  That's generally not a good way to go, though, because more careful analysis should be used.  It boils down to taking a little more time.  With that being said, if this game were played on GK, I would've taken more time and used analyze the board, which I'm spoiled by.  But, in OTB chess, I feel that I get a little careless due to feeling too comfortable, which is similar to what happened in my game with Ken.  I feel it's good and play with OTB games, rather then, giving it a closer look since I don't know what else to consider here.  In this context, the only other move that came into consideration was 5...e6 with a similar idea.  With this move played, however, I feel that my Be8 will have better mobility, once I develop it.
,Meanwhile, Tom continues with his development.
,As do I by completing the fianchetto.
,Giving his Be3 more support, as Tom plans to exchange.
,But, nothing stops me from castling, at once.  And, Tom is thinking the same way since he will play the same move.
,This is going to force and exchange.
,Instead, he wants to exchange pawns.   I accepted, but probably didn't look deep enough at the variations since I'm still known to not study enough.  In fact, I am guilty of still only looking at one variation, from time to time.  I might wind up asking Susan Polgar how many variations at once to study because, in general, the most I analyze is 3.  I have a feeling that more then that would be needed.  As this is an example of me analyzing only one line.  The reason for exchanging was to prevent 10.Ne5  As not only do are my only options to exchange pieces or lose tempo, but Tom would have a nice pawn chain which I was determined to prevent because of what Susan Polgar said about this in a variation of the French Defense.  What I thought very shortly about but should've looked at deeper is what happens after 10.d5, Nb4  As I thought that Tom could get a discovered attack on my N by moving his Nc3.  But, it was protected by the very pawn that I exchanged.  Had I taken this into consideration, I would have tried to refuse the exchange with 9...Nh5, or 9...Nd7.
,Tom also wanted to exchange my Nc6 for his N.  But, I refused because I felt that my N was stronger then his Nd4.  What comes to mind is the Visualization Count and, consequently, how much mobility it can get by moving it.
,And, Tom was worried about a different exchange which I could have accepted earlier.  But, I can understand why he thought that.
,Not knowing what his Nc3 might be capable of later on, I decide to pin it since this appears to be his stronger Knight.  What I overlooked is what comes next because Tom is going to force an exchange that I did not desire.  Had I been a little bit more careful, I would've been to refuse the exchange by relocating my Ne5 since I wasn't ready to do it here.
,As it also gives Tom tempo with this move.
,Hitting my Bishop which is going to force another exchange.  Being that what's attacked is pinned, I must prevent Tom from winning a piece.

,To prevent an immediate e5 and to do e5 later.
,Well it's not the best continuation but it's still fine. Be2 or h3 are more popular and have more success.
,Preparing e5 or c5. The knight block the way of the bishop but most of the time it's better to let him at c8 since he already facing a free diagonal.
,It's most of the time better to close the position for white since it blocks the way for the bishop on g6 and black has less space to move his pieces.
,The idea of c6 is to block Nb5, making a way for my queen and the possibility to free white's dominance on the center. The f5 push for black is not a good strategy because light square bishop is on d3 at the moment.
,The knight on c5 is a very classical position for black and most of the time black make a5 before to prevent b5. Here the knight threats e4 and d3.

"I've always found it difficult to argue against a developing move. It is what we drum into players. Even here, white castles and improves king safety. An interesting line that leads to a draw comes up in the following game played in a 2003 Germany matchup between a senior master and a GM: 6. Ng1 Bd6 7. Nge2 Ne7 8. d3 Ng6 9. O-O O-O 10. f4 Nxf4 11. Nxf4 exf4 12. Bxf4 Bxf4 13. Rxf4 Qd4+ 14. Kh1 Be6 15. Qe1 c5 16. b3 b6 17. Ne2 Qd6 18. Qf2 Rad8 19. Rf1 Qe5 20. Ng3 Rfe8 [Holzhaeuer,M (2407)-Gyimesi,Z (2596) Germany 2003 1/2-1/2]

,?! - A bit critical as it does not address black's vulnerable kingside, it's a relatively good move because regardless, I plan to castle towards the kingside anyways (with the lethal lsb gone and the queen currently immobile, I don't fear what the knights will do) Alternatives here include 6... c5, the more natural looking 6... Bg4 7. h3 (or 7. d3 Qd7 8. Be3 h5 9. h4 O-O-O 10. Qe2 g5 11. hxg5 fxg5 12. Bxg5 Be7 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Qe3 Ng6 15. Nxe5 Nxe5 16. f4 Nf7 17. e5 Rdg8 18. Ne4 Bh3 19. Rf2 Rh6 20. Kh2 Bf5 21. Qa7 Kd8 [Kroone,G-Euwe,M Amsterdam 1923 0-1]) 

,With this move, I make my intention clear that I am going to castle kingside. Almost as if my king is saying: ""Here I am, come get me if you can!""
,Perhaps for consideration would be 9. d4 O-O. Unless a b4 move was being played in the near future, I saw no point for this. at this time.

,Perhaps an idea for an attack from white, as there aren't many opportunities in the game given begin with the subtle 10. h3 c5, preparing for a g4 aggressive push on the kingside. 

,I also considered Nc6 here but felt this would be OK for development

,?! - Was a little surprised to see this honestly. Willingly adding the queen to the pin. I expected 12. Rde1 Bxf3 13. gxf3 Qc8

,I initiate a plan to get rid of the other bishop, by disguising an attack on the vulnerable d4 square.
,If white had seen what I was doing, then the proper response would have been 13. h3 Bh5.

,The other reasons I wanted to exchange the knight off: add the missing link to my pawn chain and free up my bishop. 
,By now the damage is done, and it's time to execute another phase of my plan to destroy white's queenside.
,Alternative variation: 16. Ra1 Be6. This move just adds to the tempo loss white has sustained.

,Now it's time to send in the soldiers, the battle is going to ensue shortly! Komodo recommends here: 18... Rfd8 19. Rd1
,Passive movements like this had me wondering: did white ever have a plan of attack in this game? Defense is good, but with no effective counterpunching strategy, the battle will be over very quickly. I felt black had the positional edge here. Alternative variation: 19. c4 dxc3 20. bxc3 Rfd8, to at least break up the pawn chain a little bit and give white some breathing room.

,Adding one more defender to my pawn structure for strategic purposes. Komodo recommended 19... Bc7

,Alternative variation: 21. a4 c4 22. bxc4 bxc4 23. Nxc4 Bxc4 24. dxc4 Rxc4

,Komodo suggested that 22... Rab8 seems even better 23. Qa2, but I felt either way would work fine for what I wanted to accomplish

,This was accurately detected by the GK engine. With this defender gone, my soldiers have found the opportunity they need to move in and strike. Prepare for some fireworks: (Compare Komodo's line: 23. b4 Qe7 24. Rcb1 Qa7 25. bxc5 Qxc5 to GK's line: 23. Qa2 Kf7 24. Nef3 axb3 25. cxb3 c4 26. dxc4 Bxa3 27. Rd1 Rc8 28. Qc2 d3 29. Qa2 Bc5 30. Qxa8 Rxa8 31. Rxa8)
,! - A vicious blow. Now reader, before proceeding: stop and plan out your next move carefully. 4 options: the d-pawn, the b-pawn, and the knight all can take. Or you can not take at all. What do you do and why?
,Well here is what my opponent did, and here are the alternative options. Did you pick something I did not cover? Alternative variation #1: 25. bxc4 bxc4 26. Nxc4 (26. dxc4 Rxb2 [Discovered attack]) 26... Rxb2 [Discovered attack]
Alternative variation #2: 25. dxc4 bxc4 26. bxc4 (26. Nxc4 Bxc4 27. bxc4 Qc6 [Decoy Double attack] (27... Rxb2 [Remove defender Deflection Pinning])) 26... Rxb2 [Clearance Deflection Pinning]
With any of the options, you can clearly see that white was in serious trouble and positionally was on the verge of collapse. But this isn't how the game would end!

"Joe starts off with the usual.
,Dan played the Owen's Defense.  Since, for only the second time, I'm seeing that against two really strong players, there's still something for me to learn.  The first time I saw this was during the GAC era.  Even though, I don't take that seriously given that he's a thing of the past, I still remember from that far back.  This was similar except that it wasn't too GM's, but it's the first time I've seen it with strong players during a blitz game like this.  It doesn't matter, however, as Joe is about to give up his Q for a pawn in the usual way.
,This move was played for tempo gain.  Being a Q for pawn down, he'll do whatever he can to catch up time.  Yes, this is one of Joe's strategies.  I saw a similar example in a game that fiercequeen annotated.  The only thing is that material was level, but constant gain of tempo is what allowed white to win the game.  So, it's very important, even here.
,With that being said, I believe that much better was for Dan to retreat his Nf6.  This move gives Joe a minor piece for a pawn as compensation.  But, after this move, Dan doesn't give anything else away.
,Opening up a line for his Bc1.
,Similarly, Dan opens up a line for his Bc8.
,This where Joe, formally, develops his first piece.  What I mean is that guideline of develop your minor pieces.
,I don't understand why Dan played this.  It doesn't help with his development in any way.  Instead, it hinders his Nb8.  That's why, as black even in blitz, I would've played 7...Nc6.
,As now, Dan is falling behind in development.  Might seem little, but against a senior master, however, it is a big deal.
,Trying to put pressure against Joe, Dan throws in this check.  But, from my perspective, it wasn't necessary.  As now, black's Q appears to be out prematurely.  In fact, it's out, just about, as soon as, what I saw with Botvinik when he played Fischer.  It can be argued, however, that Joe brought it out earlier since he gave it away.  But, white can get away with not following the principles because of who he's against.  However, opponents who are not as strong should at least follow some of the guidelines.  Not doing so can be a recipe for trouble.  And, that is often the case in games like this.
,As the check helped Joe since another piece is now in play and well coordinated with the other N.
,This is where Dan starts developing another piece.  
,The best part, however, is that Joe had a very good spot to castle, whereas, Dan does not have that opportunity.
,Just like before, I don't see the point behind this move.  It doesn't develop anything.  I know that it's not all development, and that's not how I usually think.  But, against a Senior Master, I feel that it's vital.  Afterall, the idea is, ""know your principles.""
,As now, Joe has a better place for his N.  In part, it's because his Bf1 is now free to move about.  In addition, this is an important tempo gainer.  So, despite remaining this far down, I strongly favor white's position here.
,As now, Joe is planning to attack the B again.
,This time, I do see the point behind this move.  Dan is threatening to expose the black K.  The plan is to break through and double up white's pawns on the b file where Joe would be forced to recapture away from the center.  After that, black can prepare for something like ...Qxa3+ with a devastating attack.  In fact, it would pretty much be a forced mate.  For example, 14...Qxa3 15.Kb1 Qxa2+ 16.Kc1 Qa1#   Instead, I would've played 13...Nd7, so that even after 13.h5, black has gotten another piece developed.  However, being that Joe would not allow that, I give this move as an inaccuracy.  Once again, it's not going to help with black's development.
,To prevent black's next move from being a problem such as the checkmate example as shown above, Joe played this.
,This is the move that I was worried about.  As now, capturing leads to mate.
,! And, being that this was only 5 minutes, there's a good chance that I would've overlooked this opportunity and allowed the checkmate or further loss of material which may even lead to resignation.  With that being said, this was well executed by Joe, and I give him credit for that just based on an incorrect assessment that I would've mate which would lose immediately.

"I would've played 34.Rxh7 but didn't want him to get my a3 pawn.  That's because after 34.Rxh7 Kxa3 35.Rxc7 Kxb3, nothing would stop Ted from getting a pawn back with 36...Kxc5.  What I overlooked is that 36.c6 would've stopped that.  So, better was to take right away on h7.
,As this move took me off guard.  
,However, this move prevents Ted from getting a pawn back.  And, when he recaptures...
,I take at once with this move.
,Not surprisingly, Ted protects.
,So, I throw in a nasty check.  Of course, my plan is to promote my a pawn by remembering that the R belongs behind the passed pawn.
,With that, I also remember that passed pawns must be pushed.  Thus, I anticipate Ted's next move.
,Therefore, I leave more room for my passed pawn by bringing the R further back.  My plan is to keep pushing my passed pawn, until it reaches the seventh rank.  That way, I'd be able to play Rb8, which would enable the promotion.  
,Not surprisingly, Ted goes after my R.
,So, I continue with my plan.  
,I did see this coming, as I'm forced to abandon my passed pawn to protect the R.  So, I come up with a different plan that will work.  That is, to win his g pawn.
,What I overlooked is that his c pawn is a passer.  So, he can still try for counterplay using Hope Chess.  That is, hoping that I won't see his plan which would enable him to promote.  But, I see his plan and am thinking about how to handle it.  The idea is not to throw away your advantage or win by underestimating your opponent.  Thus, despite being way ahead, I must be careful, and I am.  As right after this move, I see what Ted is planning to do and have every intention to stop it.  I start by taking his g pawn.
,As I asked myself the question that Susan mentions, and that's, ""What's to do"".  But, I found the answer to that.
,As this move is what allows my R to reach the same file as his pawn, thus, putting an end to his threat.
,But, I can still understand where Ted is hoping that I'll make the mistake and forget about the pawn.  Afterall, when you're at a disadvantage like this, the only you can do is Hope Chess.  And, that's by hoping that you're opponent will make a mistake and not see the threat.  But, I know what he wants.
,And, this is where I stop it.  That's because no matter what he does, I'll take his pawn.  And, even when he gets my a5 pawn, he's just left with his K against my K+R+3 pawns.  Thus, there is no hope for him left.  That's because in addition to what I just said, I'm not going to give him a lucky break by allowing stalemate, if Ted decides to continue.
,Right after this move, Ted resigned.  He implied that this was a lost position by admitting that there he has nothing left.  Had he not resigned, I would've played 47.Rb1 to keep his monarch confined to the a file.  Then, I would just keep pushing my f pawn until it promoted.  After the promotion, I would've checkmate on a8 with that promoted pawn.  Overall, I enjoyed how this game went, but it still shows that I need to work on my assessment.  This time, I gave Jack a ride to his house, as it was raining like cats and dogs.  But, while we were sitting and talking, Jack said that he was upset that I played 14.Nxe5  As first, one piece was hanging and then, I hung another.  Thus, I was too advanced to be making a mistake like that.  Well, he was wrong about my 14th move.  But, I made that very mistake on the 15th move.  Trying to treat it like a Domiano's Defense, left me with 2 pieces attacked.  I could and should've wound up the equivalent to a pawn down.  But, I got lucky that Ted blundered and allowed me to catch up on the game.  However, I'm gonna have to still work on my assessment as judging the position accurately is crucial.  A mistake has costed me multiple games, including two of my most recent games, both of which ended earlier today.

"Tournament game I am annotating at the request of the_hog.  Welcome comments/suggestions from all.
,Pretty standard Petrov 3 knights
,Similar lines to Ruy Lopez...
,All book to this point, very standard stuff...
,I like the more aggressive e5 here, offering knight exchange.
,Not one to look at a free pawn and let it go, I opted to take...
,Better to castle or perhaps d3, though castle and getting the king to safety is the better play.
,I also considered Nc5.
,I also thought White could have played Nxd4, but some prefer bishops to knights.
,Looking to protect the d4 pawn
,Given the position of the LSB on d3, it should be a priority to get the DSB in the game, so b3 should be given a hard look.  Also, this move basically encourages trading a bishop for something else with a pawn push, making it a negative play.
,Natural follow up
,The best play was Bb1, this move is now going to trade a piece for a pawn.
,I like that he took right away, getting the pin over with.
,I think Nf4 would be more natural here.
,Prepping to castle.
,Perhaps White is looking to acquire the pawn on d3?  A better play would be to get the DSB in action by moving the b pawn.  Once you castle your development isn't complete until you connect your rooks.
,My eventual goal is to get my LSB into the game and get some movement on my d7 pawn, but this move allows me some options on piece trading if it becomes advantageous.  Also, there is an open vertical to the king and if I can pincer that knight by eventually moving my queen to b6, there could be some options for a nice attack.
,Apparently going after the pawn at d3.  A lot of moves just to get rid of a pawn that isn't going anywhere...  Better to connect the rooks first.
,If White is going to focus on the pawn, I might as well get to reposition my pieces for free in the process...

"Can I put a ! on this unnatural move? If Ng5+ now I can play Kg6, then h4 to defend, h6 to kick him out... another game!
,!? It further complicates things, and I got distracted by a call. I was considering Kg6 anyway, but I feared it was then very easy for him to set a R lift and get a mate net. 
,? The intended move was Kg8. A costly blunder. 
,Now, I have to play RxR first, but I was not fully into the game. A pity. 
,Incredibly, my position still ""seems to"" hold, and now the white N seems trapped with no escape. White has to take Bxf5, but has to exchange R first. RxR, KxR, Bxf5 and white is ok, has recovered the pawn and the game can go on. 
,? My turn to benefit from my opponent's omissions. 
,I thought I was very smarte: BxB+, RxR+, KxR... and BLACK IS BUSTED due to the threat on b7! But I didn't realize it during the game. 
,? Throwing away the win. 
,Rf1 first was still much better. Kg6 is the only option, and his N can escape via f8+. If Kgoes to f, g4 wins the B...
,The dust has settled, and I have two free pieces. I can still put myself into some trouble, but as long as I control his R's penetration, there is no point in going on. 
,The white R still can't penetrate, there is nothing to fight for. 
,No real plan, but it's a matter of time. My opponent gave up.

"this game started more than three months ago, and this must be one of the reasons I truly and utterly hate correspondence chess; especially at 5 days per move... mind you, at this rate a player earns an extra day per week over the weekend, to prevent you from timing out over the weekend; like all players who are liable to time out on Friday... this player decides to use them all up; avoid these players, if you can: they try to make you lose out of boredom...

,losing swifter than Kh1, Rfe6, Qg2, Re2, Qxh3, Rxb2...
,not much better was g4, fxg4, or Qg2, Rxg3...
,three months in the game; 29 moves in 96 days amounts to 3.31 days per move, which is not bad after all... only Ne5 - to knock out Bc6, and cover for f3 - may help... follows Rxe5, and back to Re3; mate is soon in the air... main treath is Rxf3, Nxf3, Bxf3+... in this position, White timed out; in vacation mode, so he gets 5 days extra... right...
,another useless move, after nearly ten days...
,there we go... Nxf3 (Rxf3?, Qg1+!!, Rxg1, Rxg1#), Bxf3+, Rxf3, Qxf3+, Kh2, Nf4... then what?

"Feeling that the glaucoma might have gotten the best of Jack, as it did in my first game with Carl, I recaptured this way.  As it appeared to win back what I lost.  But, what I overlooked is that it's really not compensation since I'm down a piece for a pawn.
,As now, I'd like to avoid liquidation with his material advantage.  But, there are no choices as mate was threatened.  The only other option was 20.Qd2, but then black would've exchanged, anyway.
,So, doing what can be done for counterplay, I attack his Bf3.  I am not surprised that Carl retreats back to b7.
,But, I am determined to exchange pawns with the hope of getting passed pawn.  As the idea is to push pawns and not pieces.  Of course, what's causing me to be impatient is the same thing as before.
,With a potential threat against black, Carl opens up here.  Of course, the other big plan is a pawn chain, where Carl would get an unstoppable passed pawn.
,Thinking about mobility, I decide to put pressure on the fifth rank.
,But, Jack will have none of that and advises Carl to attack my Be3.
,I'm fine with that and try to come up with an attack starting with liquidation.  Although, I overlooked something which makes liquidation still harmful.  The problem is that I'm too comfortable with my position here just like with my second game with Ken.
,Therefore, as the idea was using my Rook, it was counterproductive as now, my Rf5 is no long of help since it can't stay on the fifth rank.
,The entire plan behind exchanging was attacking his Bb7 and trying to put comprises.  The plan though did not work since this move is powerful.  And, that's combined with those dangerous passed pawns.
,So, I try to put pressure on his a6 pawn.
,And, I overlooked this discover attack.  As I grab his a6 pawn.  Being, as noted, too comfortable, my thought was, yes, I'm finally getting some compensation by winning this pawn.  I was partially correct since 30.Nxc7 will be played.  But, there is no reason to be happy yet.
,As Carl win my c2 pawn.  Which therefore means that the compensation is only temporary.
,Doing what I can to promote, I push the c2 pawn since the idea is that passed pawns must be pushed.
,So, Carl attacks my Rook, in return.
,But, I had an answer to that since my Rf6 is protected by the very piece that delivered the check.  In fact, that was the logic behind this move.
,As now, not only is his Bishop attacked, but I will take his f7 pawn with check.
,After which, I continue pushing my passed pawn.
,I am not surprised to see a check thrown at me.  But, I get out of it by attempting to centralize my monarch.
,Not surprisingly, Jack is after my c pawn which is why he recommended this move to Carl.

"My bishop on f5 seems to be pinned but the knight on the f file have no good move.
,Took a lot of time to find that move, I couldn't find a better continuation than to attack on the queen side while white is struggling. The queen and the bishops have too much a dominant position to get out of these files. A better move would have been an immediate b5!
,?? Now black can continue to push easily. Nc3 was better.
,No turning back! Now black has an easy end game.
,White cannot both defend the pawn and the knight.
,The game is over. White cannot stop both the e pawn and those on the queen side. One of my most straight forward and accurate game, strategy wise, in a blitz game.

"White adopts an aggressive approach against the Najdorf.  These initial moves were all knocked out very quickly.
,White's first long think of the game produced a fairly standard move.
,I don't think I thought long enough about this.  White's dark squared bishop becomes very powerful on its new outpost.
,This was a difficult decision.  I eventually decided that the potential attack against a king-side castled position would just be too powerful and that I could give as good as I got from the queenside position: perhaps somewhat naive!
,White completes his development with this excellent centralising move, overdefending e4 and thus giving him flexibility of movement.
,To facilitate lining up major pieces on the c file and get them off the same diagonal.
,White immediately responds with the threat of the skewer and the possible check on a7.
,As planned ...
,White takes time to respond to the battery...
,? Completely overlooking White's next move, which sets up threats on the e5-b8 diagonal.  I think an immediate 16. ...Nd7 would have been better.
,!
,At the time I thought this was just a pawn-grabbing waste of time but it also increases White's control of the black diagonals.
,?  Completely missing White's response.
,!  If I recapture on d6, 21. Be5 wins immediately.
,I'd intended to swap on b3 but now I felt that it was imperative to contest control of e5 again.
,White increases the pressure again.
,Glad to get rid of that bishop!
,An attempt to counter-attack but I'm already doomed.
,Now the threats are of the mating kind.
,and of the forking kind ...

"What is this?? It's the Old Benoni Defence, though I didn't know that at the time.
,Taking the pawn looks suspect, though it seems playable if the number of responses in the database is anything to go by.
,I've been playing 1.d4 followed by 2.c4 in all games with White recently, and though Black's surprise on his second move made me divert, now I can go back to the game plan.
,Black's going to have a very cramped defence, which is fine by me.
,I've found out what the opening is by now, and am expecting e6 at some point. But my opponent is ""winging it"" (and doing it well) so who knows?
,I carry on developing...
,Black leaves e6 for the time being.
,Getting a solid central pawn formation already. There's a definite risk to the Benoni, I read, and given the opening is where I usually gain ground against my opponent, I'm confident.
,Releasing the light-squared Bishop, a piece which, apparently, struggles to find its place in this opening. Its options are certainly limited.
,I limit them some more!
,Finally Black contests my spearhead in the centre.
,I can see where this is going and decide I'll have both Bishops pointing at Black's K-side.
,I have all those diagonals free! Actually, I find later, taking with the c-pawn is more modern and probably better.
,Black pins my Bishop.
,But not for long.
,I think this is a bit of a premature sortie. But it does open that long diagonal for the Bishop on g7, which is doubtless the idea.
,I'm rather playing into Black's plan, but his Q-side isn't yet developed and I have lots of space.
,Black has achieved his aim, and that b-pawn is under a little pressure . But he's still way behind.
,I want to get my Bishop out, so decide to cover the b-pawn. It's perhaps a bit of a wasted tempo, since I'll want to move the Rook again at some point, and in fact could probably have played the Bishop out (13.Bg5?) anyway.

"Blocking with a different piece works out worse. This was a reasonable practical decision by black to give up the exchange and try to survive or win a worse endgame. 
,(?) Following through with the plan, but in the worst possible way. This line just gives black too much counterplay and a pawn for the exchange. Taking on e7 was better, and the computer likes some 14. Nxf6+ lines here as well. I never considered them. 
,This is why taking on f8 was not a great idea first. Now if I let black grab the bishop with check I'm almost certainly worse. As it is I'm still better, but only by the slimmest of margins. I won the game in the opening and now I have to win it again in the middlegame. 
,Only move. Allowing Nc2 would be crazy and black would be a pawn up in an ending. 
,Finally recapturing the material. Sensible. 
,Developing with tempo. 
,Taking the eye off the e1 square seems questionable but perhaps if Nc6 taking on f6 to gain an outside passed pawn was something black didn't want to allow. In either case they have to do something. 
,Taking the newly vacated sqare and keeping the king locked in out that side. Developing with Nd2 also seems fine. 
,Developing
,And white finishes development. Black was a rook move will also finish their development. The opening battle is complete and, with the exchange of queens the game has skipped over some sort of middle game. So, as this series is an examination of the opening, what has transpired and what is the material balances and plans in the position for both sides? 

White is an exchange up and is well developed with a nice safe king. For that, black has a pawn, which is a potentially strong passed pawn on the c-file. They are also well developed and their potentially weaker king position might be a strength because queens are off. White is better and want to trade some minors, pressure the b and c pawns with rooks, and try to cut off black's counterplay and so play for a win or draw. Black has a nice b6 bishop and could try to pressure the f2 pawn. Or they could put the rook on the h-file and try to get an attack against the white king. Knights are also tricky pieces and so they should always be on the lookout for tactics and forking variations. So a reasonable opening where white is better but clearly still has some work to do and there are issues in the position to be aware of. 
,Centralizing, and with the d3 bishop unguarded, giving the option for some discovered attack in the future with tactics to come. 
,My thought is to trade of the very strong b6 bishop to alleviate pressure on f2
,(?!) Now Black entered into a very forcing sequence that, in my opinion, was a mistake. First of all this trade of the knight for bishop, while good, is not as good as it might be able to be in the future. The threat of the discovery is stronger than the execution. Also all the simplifications benefit white by trading down to a better endgame. Black really wants to keep some complexity in the position and trade in a more favorable way. It's possible they thought they were winning the f3 pawn at the end of it all, which would have made it worth it
,The point of Nf3+
,Taking away the very strong bishop. 
,Taking with the c-pawn seems like a mistake as one of black's long term ideas is to push the passed c-pawn to create counterplay. 
,Protecting f3 and trying to trade a pair of rooks. 
,Again black wants to keep some play in the position or they are just in a worse/losing endgame. 
,It might seem like a poor choice to trade a reasonably strong bishop for a knight that doesn't have a bunch of great squares but it has a very concrete idea. It doubles blacks pawns and so creates in outside passed pawn. The h-pawn can now march down toward royalty and give black fits trying to defend it. 
,Right now black is threatening to win the a-pawn and so have 3 connected passers and suddenly great winning chances.

"But, ION pushed another passed pawn.  And, with it he has a pawn chain.  With that, Charles resigned here.  That's because black will use those two pawns down the fourth the and fifth rank all the way to the promotion square.  It will be one on top of the other, so that if ION promotes, and Charles takes one of them, black will promote and win the Rook in the process.  With that being said, the position is hopeless for white.

"I have to be careful. If Rxg2+, Kh1, Rxf7 (say), white has Bh5+, etc. If pieces are exchanged, my own caged pieces and exposed K may become a factor...
,My escape route, as planned. My K will become exposed, but he has an escape route...
,! If Kxc6, Bf3+ and the game is over! But thanks to my R on g7, my K is safe for the moment. OF course, a direct cxb7, Bxb7 is winning. 
,The best for the white Q. Now, with few seconds on the clock, I was so confused about how to take the best advantage of the position, that I made a fatal mistake. 
,...and now what? I feel I have missed the right combination. Here, Qxb2 seems decisive, since if KxN, Rg1#. BUT white has Qxe4+, and I can't play Bd6 or QxR... and if Kxc6, Be8+... AAAghh!!!
,I sacced the N, but defending e5, just in case. I didn't see Be2, but if played, Rg1+, KxR, QxBe2, threatening mate on g2, and with Nc2 as a ""plus"" in case all goes wrong...
,?? It was very few time, and I missed the winner. Anyway, this should be winning... if I keep my mind together!
,...and now I can't see how to continue the attack. True, I can take the Nb1, I can risk something like a5, but he can now give me check on f7, and he can take my Bf8... too risky! I can still lose this!
,?? It was so simple to play Bc4... :-(
,Sob! Material is even again - but the position is still thrilling. Now I tried to win some time with silly checks.
,? My plan is to make him land on a black square, or something, so to save my B and prevent him to harass my K. Yes, I can win the Ra1 (Qc1+, Ke2, Qxb2+, K moves, QxR), but this leaves my B and my K in a very difficult position - or, at least, I assumed it was! So...
,I can see no mate, and he has to take care of f2.
,Curiousely, if I exchange Q, he will have the same chances as me. I have lost too much, I have to accept my fail, and get to recover the material while I can. 
,Now: I am a R up, but my pieces are still pinned in its initial squares... so my extra R is not really playing. And both K so exposed... is this a crazy game?
,Seconds on the clock. I can't lose this by time. Bd6 was easy, but I needed simplification...
,My wonderful lsb holds all my position... from his initial square!
,? He was with seconds, too...
,...hoping in..
,?? 
,It was not a great game, from both sides. But I kept on and managed to save a difficult game (after a sound blunder!), and stressed him too much to the end.

"Queens to the front!
,What's this my Knight is going opposite way! his 3 pieces and a pawn vs 2 pieces, black has gone insane!
,Use the pin to scare king
,And finally Knight on a great outpost
,And white protects the hanging pawn but now if my queen gets to the 2nd row it can be lights out!
,Aiming for second row if white overlooks the Knight threats it's gg 
,Hmm looks like he sees the threat
,Gonna be hard for white to puncture through now!
,My opponent blunders here he did overlook the queen to the 2nd row and this is just a dropped knight
,Bam my first mistake! Worst part is I did look at rxh4 but only for two moves and thought I'd get my checkmate. But if white were to defend properly rxg5 is a dropped knight while rxh4 is a dropped pawn and rook for no compensation. So always look carefully more than 2 moves guys c'mon! ;)
,My opponent gave me a good scare and came at me aggressively. Sadly he ended on two blunders overlooking threats and the strength of my Outpost.

,In another line, White attacked with the Queen via a4, so I decide to prevent that check.
,I'm surprised to see that White still plays the Queen here; I have quite missed its significance.
,I'm still building up against g2 and miss the deadly threat...
,Of course, now the Knight has moved, White's Knight is allowed here; the c-pawn is pinned and the horrible fork on f6 is unavoidable. I'm doomed already.
,I decide that I'll get the other Rook on the open file even if it does allow White to pinch my a-pawn.
,White has no intention of going pawn hunting though, pinning my Knight instead. I have a few rather hopeful threats left...

,Any hope of a win on g2 has gone and I should look to whatever defence I can muster, retreating to e6.
,Defence, though, will simply entail a slightly longer game!

"Breaks the pin, but more importantly, prevents an exchange that would have scrambled White's K-side.  Now there is no question of Bxc6 to break up Black's Q-side.
,This seemed very natural, but maybe ...Qe8, with ...Qh5 in mind, merited consideration.
,This looks good, and brings a rather aloof knight back into the action.  Once again, 16.c3, to reinforce the centre, might have been considered.  
,!?  At the time, I thought this a fine move to bring Black back to an approximate equality, or only a very slight minus.  The Gameknot Engine calls this a mistake: 16… Nxd4 17. Nxb7 Nxe2+ 18. Rxe2 Qe8 19. Qxd5+ Kh8 20. Bd4 Bxf3 21. gxf3 Nf6 22. Qb5 Qxb5 23. axb5 Rae8 24. Rxe8 Nxe8 with a nigh-on winning end game for White.  But Black might have done better (after 17.Nxb7) with 17...Nxf3ch! and whether White takes with pawn or bishop, 18...Bxh2ch! keeps Black in the game.  To maintain an edge, maybe White would have to retreat 19.Kf1.  This is all very well: during the game I barely glanced at the 17.Nxb7 line.  However, I could have looked at alternatives such as 16...Bxc5 or 16...Qe8.
,!  from here on comes a wild melee of exchanges that wipes out most of the active pieces on both sides, and leaves White with the slenderest of margins.
,! Well played.  I would have been very pleased had White played 18.Bxc5 instead.  Black would have at least an equal game - maybe even an edge.
,!  Best, I think.  18...Kxg7 19.Qd4ch Qf6  20.Qxg4ch doesn't look so bad for Black, but the pawn margin would have persisted with not much that Black could show for it.
,Forced, as taking the f8-bishop would have left Black the exchange down and a lost game.
,A tempo-gaining capture that for the two minor pieces, White obtains a rook and TWO pawns.  Instead, 20.Rxe2 Kxf8 =.
,!  Excellent move, avoiding a nasty threat.  After 21.Rxe2?? Bxh2ch would have been winning for Black.
,Black plans to offer the exchange of queens.
,Marking the end of the middle game phase, and beginning the 'early end game' phase.  Almost 70 moves remain to this game, and it might even have been longer, but keep reading.  There will be further points of interest along the way...
,There was no compelling reason for White to go along with this exchange (e.g. 24.Qg4ch was playable), but no particular reason not to, either. 
,Now, with White to play, the game enters a whole new phase.  Time to pause and reflect.  White has rook and two pawns for bishop and knight.  According to the standard scale of values, White is a pawn ahead, but practice indicates that (R+2) and (B+N) are close to equal.  For the moment White has no real weaknesses, though c2 is likely to become one.  It can't really be said Black has any, neither.  White has a 3-1 majority on the K-side, the pawns are level, and the f-pawn is 'passed' - Black can stop its promotion only with pieces or the king.  This sounds good for White, but there is a down side: White will have to look to the K-side only to make progress, unless he can induce a vulnerable weakness on the other wing.  Black's advantage is in the flexibility - handiness - of his pieces.  Bishop, knight and rook work pretty well together.  I assess the game here as roughly level.  Maybe White has a whisker of an edge, but no more.  On the other hand, both sides have plenty to play for, for now. 
,Tidies up the Q-side a bit so that the a1-rook can move.
,Centralising.  This placement is fairly arbitrary, but opens the possibility of seizing the file outright by ...Be5.  Also possible were ...Rf8 or ...Rg8, as equally active posts.
,To make any progress at all, White has to do something with his major trumps: his majority and the passed pawn.  This move prepares the advance of the f-pawn.
,The advance of the g-pawn does come at the cost of leaving weaknesses that Black might try and exploit.  This knight move eyes ...Nd4 with attacks on c2 and f3.  They aren't much, but White isn't giving much away.
,Partly to place a half-pin on the bishop, preventing ...Bc5, but also to prevent ...Nd4.  Black's options are fairly limited at the moment.
,Taking time out also to tidy up the Q-side.  A useful 'waiting' move to see how White will proceed.  Note that now the bishop has sanctuaries on d6, c5 and b4, which could prove useful.

"So, I try something else, as now my Queen is mobilized, and more importantly are my Rooks being connected, at once.
,Trying to exchange pawns, but I missed the big picture.
,? Not knowing what else to do, I centralize my other Rook.  But, exchanging was needed here.  The big picture is what's coming.  At worst, I thought that this just lost tempo which as you know, isn't my big concern.  That would be me trying to dig out my collection of chess quotes, rather then seeing the entire board.  But, I overlooked it here as it doesn't just gain tempo.  What I forgot is that my Nf6 is still pinned, so I can't get out.  At best, Stanley is going to get a favorable exchange.
,?? Figuring that there's no way out, my attitude is very similar to my second game with Ken.  As I got too comfortable here.  My attitude is that if Stanley takes my N, I'll recapture his B.  But, I overlook what comes next since my Queen will be attacked.  And, that's why it's a free piece.  Had I been a little more cautious, I would've realized that 16...Nh7 was possible.  As that way, Stanley would win the exchange, as my N is more powerful.  But, it's better then losing material.
,As that's when Stanley retreats, and he told me that even if I prevented the immediate loss which we'll see in a little bit, he'd keep his advantage.  In other words, just like with Ken, Stanley wasn't going to give me the opportunity to win anything back. 
,Trying to figure out wherelse to go, I attempt to double up my Rooks.
,But, Stanley prevents that by attacking my Queen.
,After which, Stanley played this.  I'm not sure why, but I start attacking.
,I figured out that he was worried about mate.  Personally, I don't think any of his last two moves were mated since I didn't see any way to mate him.
,So, I go back to my plan of doubling up.
,And, Stanley intends to exchange.
,?? But, I refuse by trying to use my King as a weapon since we're nearing the endgame.  That's because I don't want to liquidate since I'm behind.  Stanley, however, pointed out that this is the move that loses at once.  As I overlooked how powerful that N is.  Instead, the best move was to exchange with 22...Bxg4, as we'll see later on.  
,Not seeing the point and figuring that Stanley might be trying to mate me, I attack his N with my next move.
,But, this was played instead.
,I can't take with the King but thought that I was fine with his move, however...
,Once Stanley played this, I resigned.  That's because my Queen is trapped with this pin.  Therefore, at the very least, he will win the Queen for a piece, at which, there is no point in continuing.  After this game, a discussion with Jack, Stanley, and I ensues.  Jack: Why didn't you exchange with 22...Bxg4  Joe: I didn't want to exchange because that would liquidate further since I'm behind.  The idea is not exchanging pieces when behind.  Stanley: True, but there is a danger that you overlooked which is my N.  Jack: How many times must I tell you to be aware of the N?  Those Knights are very dangerous, and therefore, should not let them come in like this.  Stanley: Had you exchanged, I would've remained with the advantage, but black would've been ok.  By refusing it was game over for black.

"This was a good game.  A lot of moves made to allow for me to disguise my next move and then a capture may be on the cards. -
,White went with f4 Bird's Opening and black chose d5.
,White continued to move on the kingside with h3.
,Black now decided to lock white's f4 pawn in place with f5.
,White's next move was Nf6 staking claims to squares e5 and g5.
,Black went with Nc6.
,White pushed pawn to e3 protecting his pawn at f4.
,Black also protected his centre pawns with e6.
,Now white pins the knight at c3 with Bb5.
,Black brings his bishop to d7 ready to capture white's LB if it captures the knight.
,White develops his knight to c3.
,White pushes a pawn to a6 and is attacking white's LB.
,White captures the knight at c3.
,Black recaptures the LB with his LB.
,White now attacks the LB with Ne5 whilst protected by the pawn at f4.  This is a great square in the centre of the board and is attacking f7.

,Black brings his DB to c5 and is looking at the diagonal to the king on g1.  There is a pawn on the diagonal and not much else.
