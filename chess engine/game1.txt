[White "Adolph Anderssen"]
[Black "Jean Dufresne"]
[Result "1-0"]

{Anderssen was one of the strongest players of his era (along with Steinitz
and Morphy). In this game, dubbed 'the Evergreen' game, he displays the
art of the sacrifice no less than THREE times in an attacking combination
which is simply historical. Take note of the subtelty of his 19. Rad1,
and how it unleashes utter destruction on black's position. This game has
it all - a Royal fork, a double check, and a queen sacrifice. Pretty amazing
stuff:) Enjoy!} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Guico Piano (or Italian
Game).} 4. b4 {Evans gambit. Anderssen was a big fan of this approach,
and played it excessively as white. In it, white gives up material for
an advantage in development.} Bxb4 5. c3 {With the idea of owning the center
with a solid pawn structure.} Ba5 6. d4 exd4 7. O-O {This move accomplishes
a few things. It removes the king from the danger posed by black's dark
squared bishop, secures his safety, and prepares Re1. The advantage gained
by the gambit pawn is starting to take shape.} d3 {?! Dubious, to say the
least. 7...d6 or even 7...dxc was probably better. I would love to know
what Dufresne was thinking by playing this move.....} 8. Qb3 {Hello f7.}
Qf6 {Defending the weak f pawn.} 9. e5 Qg6 {Not 9...Nxe4 because of 10.
Re1 d6 11.Qa4   OR 10. NxN QxN 11. Re1! and the f pawn is STILL weak.}
10. Re1 {! Of course.........} Nge7 11. Ba3 b5 {?! Instead of defending
more thoroughly, black offers up a counter sac in an attempt to get active
on white's queen.} 12. Qxb5 Rb8 13. Qa4 Bb6 {Black wants to castle here,
but is prevented because of 14. Bxe7 (winning a piece as the c6 knight
cannot defend both the Ne7 and the Ba5).} 14. Nbd2 Bb7 15. Ne4 Qf5 {? Black
should have castled.} 16. Bxd3 Qh5 17. Nf6+ {!! A beautiful sacrifice.
Analyze for a few minutes before moving on.................} gxf6 18. exf6
Rg8 {Setting up QxN.} 19. Rad1 {! Looks innocent enough, right? Watch.............}
Qxf3 20. Rxe7+ {Sacrifice #2...................} Nxe7 {What else could
black do?} 21. Qxd7+ {Sacrifice #3! Black is forced to re-take with his
king because 21...Kf8 loses to 22. QxN  } Kxd7 22. Bf5+ {! Double check!}
Ke8 23. Bd7+ Kf8 {23...Kd8 loses just as fast to 24. BxN} 24. Bxe7# {Checkmate!
A great long combination that culminates in a very pretty mate. Anderssen
was a master of such tactics. More famous games to come:)    Cheers,
